            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ingrafting of the humble and broken hearted ſinner into Chriſt, as we have heard, conſiſts of two particular paſſages: The firſt was being put into the ſtock; Secondly, the ingrafting into the ſome. As in ingrafting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo of implanting ſpiritually of the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. When the ſoul is brought unto this, then a ſinner comes to be partaker of all the ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, all ſhall be communicated to us. Now the point at this preſent to be handled, is called by the ſtreame of Divines <hi>Vocation,</hi> and I tearme it the putting in of the ſoule, when the ſoule is brought out of the world of ſinne, to lye upon, and to cloſe with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and this hath two particular paſſages in it; partly the call on Gods part, partly the anſwer on ours. The call on Gods part is this, when the Lord by the cal of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doth ſo cleerly reveale the fulneſſe of mercy, and certifies to the ſoule by the work of his ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4394:15"/> that the ſoule humbled returnes anſwer to Gods call.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the firſt obſerve two paſſages: Firſt, the meanes whereby God will call the ſinner unto him; the ſinner is afraid to appeare before God whom he hath offended, and may therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in juſtice againſt him for thoſe ſinnes which have beene committed by him. Now beſides the Law which diſcovers a mans ſinne unto him, hee now prepares another meanes, the voice of his Goſpell; hee lets in many ſweet inklings into the ſoule, of his love and kindneſſe to allure him, to call him, and draw him to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Lord doth not onely appoint the meanes, namely, the miniſtery of his Goſpel, whereby the ſoule may be brought unto him, and receive communion with him; but by the worke of his Spirit hee doth bring all the riches of his grace into the ſoule truly humbled, ſo that the heart cannot but receive the ſame, and give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto, and give an eccho of the ſubjection of it ſelfe to be governed thereby: that wee have finiſhed already. There muſt bee hearing before comming; not of the Law, to terrifie a man; but of the Goſpell, to perſwade and allure a man to come unto the Lord, and receive mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from him. The Goſpell is the meanes ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God to call home the ſoule unto him. But this will not doe the deed; there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, or the ſinner will be at a ſtand, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come on cheerfully, and receive the grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him; therefore beſides the meanes, wee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4394:15"/> have the ſpeciall cauſe expreſſed, which is the Lord. For when a man hath heard, that is one thing; but that is not all, for the principall cauſe is the Lord. God the Father alone can buckle the heart to receive the grace appointed, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy offered to the ſoule: and without the principall cauſe, all other meanes, I meane the Miniſters of the Goſpell, although it be <hi>a ſavour of life unto life,</hi> yet it may be <hi>a ſavour of death unto death,</hi> unleſſe the Spirit of the Lord goes with it. For when the Goſpell is onely revealed to the underſtanding, and that onely conceives of the letter thereof, and it ſoakes not, and ſinkes not into the heart: this we call an outward calling, that is the phraſe of Divines: when ſome light flaſh is imparted and communicated unto the ſoule, and is not ſet on ſufficiently, that is an outward calling. But when God the Father doth accompany the diſpenſation of the Goſpell with the powerfull operation of the Spirit, and it puts its hand to the key of the Goſpell, and unlockes a blinde minde, and a hard heart, there the ſoule learnes throughly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the way of ſalvation. The Text ſaith, there muſt not onely be hearing, but learning of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, elſe the ſoule will not, nor cannot come. Now before I can collect the ſeverall paſſages out of the words, there is ſome difficulty and obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the phraſe, therefore give me leave, as I am able, to diſcover the meaning and ſenſe of the words, and then the collection will be cleere.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the explication of the phraſe, and I will diſcourſe four queſtions unto you, which will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4394:16"/> be uſefull for the cleere explication of the Text. <note place="margin" type="runSum">4. <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, why the Father is ſaid to teach, and not the Sonne, nor the holy Ghoſt.</p>

When the Lord will propound unto, and learne the ſoules of his that belong to him, you muſt not thinke the truth tedious, becauſe they will give us light into all the truth that ſhall bee hereafter diſcuſſed out of the word.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> For anſwer hereunto, the leſſon that the ſoule muſt learne, is this, namely, the fulneſſe of the mercy, and grace, and ſalvation that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath provided, and alſo offered to the poore humbled ſinner, in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which in deed is able to doe that for a poore ſinner, which all the meanes and things in the world could not doe, and yet notwithſtanding he needs. I have heretofore diſcuſſed the poore miſerable plight which a ſinner hath brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4394:16"/> into by his manifold rebellions. There is no helpe, no hope of himſelfe, in what hee hath or doth to releeve and ſuccour himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fals flat at the footſtoole of the Almighty, and is content to be at his diſpoſing. Now the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ſoule muſt learne, is the fulneſſe, greatneſſe, and freeneſſe of the perfect ſalvation which is brought unto us through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And that we may not learne this leſſon by halfes, but fully and perfectly, and that your minds may conceive of the ſame, give me leave to lay it out fully, becauſe it will be profitable for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe: and this leſſon diſcovers it ſelfe in three things, as in three lines, as I may ſo terme it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is this, that the ſoule may learne there is enough ſufficiency in the mercy of God, to fill up all the empty chinkes of the ſoule, and ſupply all the wants that a ſinner hath, and releeve him in all thoſe neceſſities that either doe or can befall him: this is the condition of every ſonne of man ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that there is not onely a great deale of weakneſſe in the ſoule, but there is a great deale of wants and emptineſſe in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now this is the fulneſſe of the mercy of God, that whatſoever our weakneſſes, wants, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities bee, there is full ſufficiency enough in that maſſe to fill up all, and to give the ſoule full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in every particular. Hence the phraſe of Scripture runnes thus, when God propounds the fulneſſe of mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, he calls it a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and all the treaſures of wiſedome and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4394:17"/> are in Chriſt; not one treaſure, but all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; not ſome treaſures, but all treaſures, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. When the Goſpell was profeſſed, there was a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mercy, and there wee ſhall ſee a kinde of meeting and concurrency of all bleſſings together. So that where the Goſpell comes, there is joy for the ſorrowfull, peace for the troubled, ſtrength for the weake; be your miſeries what they can be, here is releefe ſeaſonable and ſutable to all your wants, miſeries, and neceſſities. Nay, this is not onely for the preſent neceſſity. Mercy is not only able to releeve your preſent neceſſity, but your future alſo. It is not with mercy as with the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> who thought when the meale in the barrell, and the oyle in the cruſe was ſpent, ſhe ſhould then ſurely periſh. No, it is not ſo in the fulneſſe and ſufficiency of this mercy; it hath not onely enough to doe you good for the preſent, and to ſuccour you in all preſent wants; but what miſeries ſoever ſhall befall thee, or what troubles ſhall betide thee for future times, the fulneſſe of Gods mercy laies in proviſion againſt ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and times of miſeries and vexations. For a poore ſinner may be driven to a ſtand after this manner: It is true, ſaith the ſinner, I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed many ſinnes, God hath ſealed up the pardon of them unto me, and thoſe ſins which have heretofore pleaſed me, God hath given me a ſight of them in ſome power and meaſure againſt them. But what if more ſins, if more temptations, if more corruptions, if more guilt, if more horror ſeize upon my heart, how then ſhall I ſuccour my
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4394:17"/> ſelfe? But now this is the fulneſſe and ſufficiency of mercy, it doth not onely caſe a man in regard of preſent neceſſity, but layes proviſion for all future wants and calamities that can befall the ſoule. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.7. The text ſaith, <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</hi> The word in the originall is, <hi>there is multiplying redemption,</hi> or redemption encreaſing: if miſery, ſorrow, and anguiſh be multiplyed, there is mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed redemption alſo. Then know it, if you know your owne ſoules; you ſee it, if you ſee your owne lives, that it is new ſinnes, new corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prevailing with you. But here is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the ſoule, as ſinne increaſeth, ſo mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; as corruption multiplyes, ſo redemption multiplyes: therefore he is called the <hi>Father of mercy;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, he begets mercy, even a generation of mercies, from day to day; and it is a large generation of new mercies framed and made to incourage poore ſoules: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>with the Lord there is a fountaine of life.</hi> Looke as it is with a fountaine, there is not onely water in it for the preſent, but it feeds ſeverall cocks and conduits; and though it runnes out daily, it enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it ſelfe daily: So with the Lord there is a fountaine of life. If there be a fountaine of death in thy ſoule, in regard of thy ſinnes to kill thee; ſo a fountaine in God to quicken thee. Hence it comes to paſſe that the Lord ſpeaking of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, calls it <hi>the exceeding riches of his mercy, Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. I ſay, the Lord hath not onely fulneſſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but he is rich in all his fulneſſe; nay, he exceeds
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4394:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> in all the riches of the fulneſſe of his mercy. So that be we never ſo poore and beggerly, theſe ſins increaſe, and thoſe miſeries increaſe; why yet though thou bee a bankrupt in grace, yet the Lord is full of goodneſſe, full of mercy; yea he exceeds in his fulneſſe, to ſuccour thy heart in all neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: nay, our miſeries and wants bee great, yet haply thy feare is greater than all the reſt; thy ſoule is troubled many times more with the feare of what will be, than with the feeling of what is already befalne thee: But now, how ever thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries be great, and thy feare exceeds all miſery that can betide; yet mercy will remove and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe feares, and Chriſt will doe more for thee, than thou canſt feare will fall upon thee: Nay, a man doth not feare what miſery can befall upon him, but his heart may imagine more than he doth feare. But here is the fulneſſe of mercy, mercy full to the brim, and running over; mercy is able to doe more for thee, than thou canſt feare or conceive ſhall come upon thee. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. then ſaith the Lord, exceeding exceſſe, <hi>abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above that we can aske or thinke.</hi> So then the words runne thus, then winde up the point, Thou ſeeſt, thou findeſt, thou feeleſt, many ſorrowes now aſſailing thee, thou expecteſt more trouble to befall thee, and thou doſt conceive more than thou doſt feare; thy ſorrowes out-bid thy heart, thy feares out-bid thy ſorrowes, and thy thoughts goe beyond thy feares: and yet here is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a poore ſoule, in all his miſery and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, the mercy of the Lord out-bids all theſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4394:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> whatſoever may, can or ſhall befall thee. Gather then up briefly, and ſhut up this firſt paſſage. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the ſorrowes of the righteous, guilt of ſinne perplexing the ſinner, and filthineſſe of ſinnes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing and domineering over the ſoule; nay, many feares and cares for future times: for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaith, Sometimes my condition is marvellous poore, my eſtate marvellous miſerable; what if ſmall temptations, what if ſmall corruptions, what if ſuch a fall ſhould betide me, what then ſhall become of my ſoule? Nay, a mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exceeds all feares. The ſoule that thinks with it ſelf, Should the Lord deale in juſtice, and ſhould my ſinnes get the victory over me, which I hope will never be, for what ſhall I then do for ſuccour? yet this is the comfort of a poore ſoule, let it read this leſſon, The Lord is able, and mercy can doe exceſſive, exceeding abundantly above all, thy ſorrowes are abundant, thy feares are very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, thy imaginations are exceſſive, exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, exceeding above all preſent ſorrowes, above all future feare, and above the courſe of all imaginations. This diſcourſe ſhall ſerve for the firſt paſſage.</p>
               <p>We will now adde the ſecond. The ſoule is not yet fully ſatisfied, but replyes, It is true, <hi>there is bread enough in my Fathers houſe;</hi> that I yeeld, and that I confeſſe; there is abundance of mercy in God, a world of mercy that pardoned <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and ſaved <hi>Saul,</hi> but what is that to me, if there be <hi>bread enough in my Fathers houſe,</hi> and I ſtarve for hunger, and get no benefit by this mercy of God?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4394:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> But how ſhall a man ſtarve in this mercy? if a way can be conceived, and a meanes can be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for another ſupply to the ſoule, to fill up the neceſſity of it, this will be ſeene in the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; I ſay herein appeares more fulneſſe of mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is not onely ſufficient to releeve a man in all the miſeries that can befall him, but this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing conſidered: mercy is able to make thee partake in the ſame mercy: God doth not leave thee to thy ſelfe, that thou ſhouldeſt buy it, and purchaſe it; and buy it, and procure it: but mercy is able to ſuffice thy ſoule, that thou maiſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed thereby. This is the tenor of mercy: God requires of a man that he ſhould beleeve: now mercy doth helpe to performe the duty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Lord, as he requires the condition of thee, ſo he worketh the condition in thee: hee makes thee beleeve that thou ſhalt be ſaved, as there is fulneſſe of grace in himſelfe to doe thee good, if thou doſt receive the ſame: this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the two Covenants, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, and the Covenant of grace. The firſt covenant runnes, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall doe and live: now it ſtood upon the uſe and abuſe of his free will, either to doe the will of God, and be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; or to breake the law, and be curſed: it was in his power to receive the life: and thus either by breach or not doing the condition required, <hi>Adam</hi> muſt performe. But it is not ſo here: the Lord in deed requires a condition: no man can be ſaved but he muſt beleeve: but here is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4394:19"/> that the Lord as he makes this condition with the ſoule, ſo alſo he keepeth us in performing the condition, for the Lord he requires that the ſoule ſhould reſt upon him, and he make him alſo to doe it: he requires the ſoule to cleave unto him. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. There is the tenor of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit I will put within you, and I will take away your ſtony heart, and give you a heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes:</hi> Or if they will walke in my wayes, out of thine owne power, then I will vouchſafe this mercy and favour. Now the Lord requires this condition, and workes it alſo in his children; he requires this of them, and he workes this in them, for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting good; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. the Lord ſaith, <hi>This is the covenant I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; I write my lawes in their hearts, and they ſhall not need to be taught.</hi> Men muſt know God, and beleeve in the Lord. Now as the Lord requires this, as the condition of the covenant; ſo the Lord will work this in them, as he requires this of them. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. the text ſaith, <hi>To them that beleeve, he gave them power to be the ſonnes of God.</hi> Now if a man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, he ſhall be ſaved. Now then hee makes a man beleeve that he may be a ſonne. This is the ſecond paſſage whereby the ſoule of a ſinner comes to be cheered: or that there is not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſufficiency in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but that mercy, as it is able to doe him good, ſo it will make him partaker of the good.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third particular is this, That as mercy hath
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4394:20"/> all good, and will make us partakers of what it hath; ſo alſo it will diſpoſe of us, and of that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon us. Mercy will not onely have a ſinner, but it will rule and order that grace it hath beſtowed upon the ſoule. For if mercy purchaſe a ſoule at ſo high a rate, as the blood of the Lord Jeſus; it is right that the ſoule purchaſed by grace, and ſupplyed with grace, that mercy ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it for the honour of God. You are not your owne, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but bought with a price;</hi> therefore you muſt glorifie the Lord in body and ſoule. Nay, it is not onely right that mercy ſhould doe it; but reaſon, and beneficiall to the ſoule, that mercy ſhould doe thus. Nay, I ſay, unleſſe that mercy ſhould rule a man, he had not beene able to give full content to the ſoule. If the Lord ſhould leave any poore ſoule to the deſtiny of his owne heart, and the malice of Satan, hee would runne to ruine preſently: he is not able to ſupply his owne wants and to diſpoſe of his owne ſpirit, and employ aright his owne ſoule. For if <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, had a ſtocke in his owne hands, fell and periſhed: then if mercy ſhould put a man into the ſame eſtate that <hi>Adam</hi> was, a man ſhould bring himſelfe into the ſame miſery that <hi>Adam</hi> was brought into: but there is that fulneſſe of that mercy, that is in Chriſt that it wil beſtow all good needfull for me; ſo alſo, it will diſpoſe of that good in me, ſo that Satan ſhall never prevaile, the world ſhall never overcome, nor my corruptions beare ſway in me; but the Lord ſhall rule me for ever: and this is the fulneſſe of Gods mercy. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4394:20"/> up the point then, that we may ſee what wee muſt learne. There is ſufficiency in mercy to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all wants: nay, there is ability in mercy to communicate that it hath, and we ſtand in need of. Nay, mercy will preſerve us; and that it giveth to us, againſt all oppoſitions that can befall thee. This is the leſſon that the ſoule muſt learne, that it may be able in ſome meaſure to ſee the way, and learne the path that leadeth to everlaſting happineſſe. This is the firſt leſſon that the ſoule muſt learne of God the Father.</p>

But why then doth the Text give it to the Father? Here I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer directly, becauſe the Father was directly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the ſinne of man. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>If wee ſinne, wee have an advocate with the Father,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to plead for us with the Father. He doth not ſay, wee take an advocate with an advocate, that doth not plead with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: the reaſon is, God the Father was directly offended; though all the perſons in the Trinity were offended, yet the Father more directly. Now he that is directly offended, favour and mercy muſt come from him, to the party that doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: and that is the reaſon why Chriſt eſpecially caſt this upon the Father. Take a creditor that hath money, or creditors that are bankrupts; now this is no meanes to helpe and ſuccour theſe men: but it lyeth upon the creditor that oweth the debt, for he onely it is muſt come to forgive the debts: for it is here God the Father, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly offended by the ſonne of man, therefore from him in the firſt place, muſt proceed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and mercy to the ſonne of man.

When the Spirit ſheweth a man his ſinnes, and ſheweth him that he is in bondage, and in fetters, lets him get out how he can: this is the ſpirit of feare and of bondage. In the ſecond place, there is the ſpirit of power. But what is this ſpirit of power? You muſt imagine this ſpirit of power doth not intimate any particular grace, but as it were the ſinewes and ſtrength of the worke of the Spirit, conveying it ſelfe through the frame of the heart and this I terme to bee the effectuall worke of the Spirit of God. When the ſoule is humbled, the Lord ſweetly communicates into the ſoule a ſupernaturall and ſpirituall vertue. Laſtly, as it is in nature, take a knife, if it be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on a Loadſtone, it will draw iron unto it; now it cannot doe that, becauſe it is a knife, but becauſe it is rubbed on a ſtone, and receives vertue there from: So it is with a heart humbled, it is a fit ſubject for the grace of God to worke upon: the love of God is like the loadſtone, and if the heart he rubbed thereupon, and affected with the ſweetneſſe thereof, it will bee able to cloſe with that mercy, and come to that mercy, and goe to God, from whence that mercy comes.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, When theſe two things meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſoule, then it hath learned this leſſon:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4394:22"/> The firſt is this, when the ſoule having heard of that plentifull redemption that is in Chriſt, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo having apprehended the revelation thereof; it commeth to cloſe with the worke of the Spirit, revealing, preſenting, and offering grace to the heart: nay, it comes to give entertainment to he riches of that mercy revealed to the ſoule. There is in the mercy of God, and in the bleſſed truth of the promiſes, a great excellency. Now when this is ſo plentifully brought home to the heart, that it breakes through all oppoſitions, which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worke of the Spirit upon the ſoule, when it is brought home by the ſpirit of God; and the heart gives way, and cloſes with it, ſo that there is nothing betweene that and the ſoule; this I take to be the firſt frame of the ſoule, that beginnes to learne this leſſon, it beginnes to cloſe to the truth, to give way to the ſweetneſſe that is in it, and bids adieu to all delight and ſinnes, and whatſoever may be a hindrance unto it, from receiving of this grace into the ſoule. This is the firſt paſſage.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, with which I will conclude is this, that as the ſoule cloſeth with that mercy, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth it, and the heart is content to take up mercy upon thoſe termes: ſo in the ſecond place, there is an impreſſion and diſpoſition left upon the ſoule, that it is framed and diſpoſed; there is a kinde of print which the ſoule hath with it; ſo that as the mercy of God is revealed to the ſoule, and communicated to the ſoule; ſo there is a kind of impreſſion, frame, and print, which the heart retaineth, and hath wrought upon it by this grace
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4394:23"/> and free favour of God made knowne: therefore that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. is a marvellous patterne to our purpoſe; the Text ſaith, <hi>they were delivered to this forme of doctrine.</hi> Looke as it is with a ſeale, if the ſeale be ſet to the wax, and leave an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, juſt ſo many letters upon the wax as in the ſeale, then it is wholly ſealed: So the Spirit of God through Chriſt, in the promiſes, doth reveale al the freeneſſe and grace of mercy in Chriſt. Now when the Spirit doth leave an impreſſion on the ſoule, that man is delivered into the truth. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. when <hi>Saul</hi> was ſent to preach to the Gentiles, the Text ſaith, he was but <hi>to bring them out of darkneſſe into light:</hi> mark, when the Lord doth come to worke effectually upon the ſoule, he brings men from under the power of darkneſſe: whereas the underſtanding was darke and blinded, when the Spirit comes, it turnes it from the darkneſſe and power of ſinne, unto the power of light and grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the power of the heart doth theſe two things: for not onely ſome of the heart muſt bee brought to God, but the whole heart: therefore in the precious promiſes of grace and ſavation, there is fulneſſe of all good, to draw all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoule unto the Lord; and therefore the faithfulneſſe and the truth of God is mainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the promiſes; now that fits the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and makes it looke to God for pardon, for power, and mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As the promiſe is a true word, ſo it is a good word; this anſwers all the will and affections; there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4394:23"/> is a poſſibility in mercy to ſave a man: hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects it; but then the ſoule muſt looke onely to Chriſt for mercy, deſire, long for it, for that there is a certainty that a man ſhall have mercy if he can deſire it; love doth welcome and delight in it, nay, the ſoule doth ſay, The Lord hath ſaid, thou muſt be ſaved: nay, thou muſt looke to Chriſt for mercy, it is no where elſe to be had: nay, if thou doſt deſire it, thou ſhalt have it; and then the Lord determines the point, it is done, mercy is thine; and then the will addes full conſent, and ſayes, Amen, Lord, let it be as thou haſt ſaid. Gather them up briefly. When the Spirit of God doth ſo cleerly preſent mercy to the ſoule, and doth leave by the over-powring worke thereof a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall worke upon the ſoule, that the ſpirit cloſeth therewith, and receives the print and impreſſion thereof: now the leſſon is fully learned: this may ſuffice for the opening of the ſeverall things; now therefore we will addreſſe our ſelves to gather the doctrines out of the Text.

Now there are two things in the worke, ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and ſome good: the evill to be refuſed, the good to be embraced. Now anſwerably to theſe 2. things, the Lord hath placed in the ſoule of a man two ſorts of feet; ſome feet carry the ſoule from evill, ſome feet againe carry the ſoule towards good.</p>
               <p>Now the affections of the ſoule, that doe reſpect evill, are eſpecially three, if any evill be comming; firſt, feare is a watchman, and the heart trembles, and ſhakes, and gives in. Hence comes paleneſſe in the face, becauſe feare goes downe into the very caſtle of a man, which is the heart; and then ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row greeves and mournes, and laments under the weight of that evill, wee feare evill to come, but we ſorrow for evill that is come. Thirdly hatred, that carries it ſelfe with a kinde of indignation, and takes up armes againſt that evill, feare is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4394:352"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 28 --> ſorrow feeling, hatred oppoſing any evil that comes. Now theſe three affections that goe from evill, have been wrought upon in contrition, and humiliation, namely, when the Lord the eye of a poore ſinner, diſcovers unto him that hell is gaping for him, and the God of juſtice preparing vengeance for him, the ſoule ſtaggers and ſhrinks in the apprehenſion of it; then the Lord lets in the fire of indignation into the ſoule, and makes the ſoule feele that before he threatned, and then the ſoule grieves; and becauſe his ſinnes have beene ſo tedious unto him, his heart is brought to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and indignation againſt thoſe evils. So that if any evill, or provocation, or temptation come to a ſoule broken, if the old looſe companions, old corruptions, old ſwearing, old blaſpheming, old dalliances come to call upon the ſoule, <hi>let us have our fill of love untill the morning,</hi> let us take up our old delights; when theſe call the ſoule, and would plucke the ſoule home againe unto them, then theſe foure fence the ſoule againſt all thoſe inchantments; in ſo much that when the drunkard ſeeth his company comming towards him, hee thinkes, that is my plague, that is the man, and his perſwaſions and counſels; hee remembers his old corruptions, and his old horrors, and his old bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and heavie loads that lay upon his heart; and the ſoule hates the drunkard, and will not yeeld to his perſwaſions, they ſo fence the way, that the voice of ſinne cannot be heard; it may call, and call, but the doore is ſhut, they ſtop the currant, that no ſtreame of diſtempers may prevaile any

                  <!-- orig ref value was 29 --> more: this now is done before: ſo that now wee come to the ſecond worke. So there are other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that carry the ſoule unto good, if there be any good propounded, or offered, then there are foure other affections that the will ſends out to entertaine that good: hope and deſire looke for the good that is abſent: hope ſaith, I marvell it comes not: deſire ſaith, I long after it: when the goodneſſe is neere, then love welcomes it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in it, and joy rejoyceth, and all theſe, hope, deſire, love, and joy, all bring, carry and convey all the good to the will, which is the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the ſoule: Love and joy tell the will, We have found much goodneſſe, and taken great delight, and much content in the goodneſſe and mercy of the Lord. The truth is, wee have taken delight in ſinne and baſe courſes; but oh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but oh the conſolation and goodneſſe of mercy; you cannot have a better good than mercy. Then ſaith the will, We will have grace &amp; mercy, wee will reſt here. Thus wee ſee how the head and the foot of the affections doe come on to embrace that good: now the underſtanding doth ſtand ſentinell all the while, and diſcovers all the good, and muſters up hope and deſire, and love and joy, and theſe foure are the maine wee muſt meddle with; all the other went from evill, and they have their proper worke before: we doe not hate and ſorrow for mercy, wee doe not feare to receive mercy, but wee feare and withdraw our ſelves from ſinne and corruptions, that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the call of mercy.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> The Doctrine is this; The holy Spirit of the Father doth ſtir the heart of an humbled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned ſinner to hope for the goodneſſe of the Lord: The Lord calleth all the affections; come joy, come deſire, come love; but the firſt voyce is to hope; only obſerve this paſſage, it muſt come from a heart humbled and inlightned, for nothing commeth to the heart to be affected, but onely by the head and underſtanding; therefore before the ſoule can hope, the heart muſt bee humbled, and inlightned: humbled, in regard of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inlightned in regard of the certification of Gods goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt be ſtirred up to doe it; the ſpirit muſt ſtir up the heart unto it: when a poore ſinner is truly abaſed, and cut off from every thing in himſelfe, and is content to be at Gods diſpoſe, yet the ſoule cannot diſpoſe of it ſelfe, it cannot carry it ſelfe to the affecting imbracing of any ſupernaturall grace or good by the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: looke as it is with a wind-mill, it is fitted for to goe, and if the winde blow, it will goe; but now the ſaile will not ſtirre the mill, unleſſe the winde ſtirre the ſaile: So here though the ſoule bee humbled and content to bee at Gods diſpoſe, yet I ſay an humble broken ſelfe-denying heart is not able to ſtirre of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To hope groundedly, it is not a flaſhy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4394:379"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 57 --> hope, a vaine hope, an idle hope; as the wicked men, they hope for grace, they hope for mercy, but they have no ground to beare them up, but the hope of ſuch men will periſh: but this hope is upon good ground; the Lord calleth the ſoule to wait upon him, to expect him; this is <hi>hope which will not make a man aſhamed, Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>We have a hope as an anchor of the ſoule more ſure and ſtedfaſt; Hebr.</hi> 6.19. this is the nature of hope to ſtand ſtill and wait for mercy and ſalvation of God, and to looke when the Lord will have mercy upon the ſoule, and this grounded hope the ſpirit of God muſt ſtirre and worke, or elſe there will never be any hope: the proofe of the point, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoule,</hi> that is all the good, and all the comfort I have in heaven and earth; he is my portion; life gone, and health gone, and friends gone, yet the Lord is my portion for ever and ever; therefore will I hope in him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule expecteth that mercy, looketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, waiteth for it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>I will allure her in the wilderneſſe, and ſpeake comfortably unto her, and give her the valley of Achor for the doore of hope:</hi> therefore the Lord will allure her in the worke of humiliation, and did ſpeake comfortably unto her in vocation; thou wanteſt mercy, mercy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee; thou wanteſt grace, grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for thee; that ſtaggering ſoule of thine ſhall be ſtrengthned, that troubled ſoule of thine ſhall be pacified; and then the ſoule commeth to hope, when the heart is throughly humbled and abaſed, then followeth hope. Now for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4394:380"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 58 --> diſcovery and explication of the point, wee will ſhew two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the reaſon why after a ſoule humbled, and the minde enlightned, the Lord worketh upon this affection of hope. Secondly, the manner how the Lord ſtirreth up the heart to hope, what bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, what feedeth it, and upon what it groweth, and what maintaineth it in the ſoule, and then the Doctrine will be very cleare.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the order, why the Lord doth proceed in the next place to ſtirre up hope.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the reaſon is this; becauſe when the Spirit of God hath enlightned the underſtanding, and given evidence, that mercy is prepared for an humbled ſoule: why (brethren) the fitteſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoule, that ought to bee imployed to lay hold upon this, it is the facultie of hope; it is the maine office of this affection in the heart, to looke and expect for a good to come; for hope is nothing elſe, but that extent of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it earneſtly affecteth a good to come: it muſt be a knowne good and to come that hope expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth: if the good be preſent, wee love it, and joy in it; but if it be abſent, the ſoule looketh out for it, and waiteth for the ſame; it is a fine paſſage of hope, 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. <hi>according to my earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hope:</hi> hope is a faculty of the ſoule to looke out for mercy; it is a ſimilitude taken from a man that looketh after another, and lifteth up it ſelfe as high as he may to ſee if any man bee comming neare him, looking wiſhly about him, ſo here the ſoule ſtandeth as it were a tiptoe, expecting when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4394:380"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 58 --> the ſoule will come: as the man that is to meet another in ſuch a place, they doe ſet the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and then goeth up to a high hill, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth very earneſtly round about him, wondreth he commeth not, and yet he hopeth he will come: ſo an humbled ſinner, when the Lord ſaith, mercy is comming towards thee, mercy is provided for thee; now this affection is ſet out to meet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a farre off, namely hope; this is the ſtretching out of the ſoule. O when will it be, Lord? thou ſaiſt mercy is prepared, thou ſaiſt mercy is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the ſoule ſtandeth a tiptoe; O when will it come, Lord. As now ſomething that hath a ſtrong ſent, a man that hath a good noſe, can ſmel a good way off; though it findeth it not, though it feeleth it not, yet it may, and ſaith hope, this ſinful ſoule of mine, it may through Gods mercy bee ſanctified, this troubled perplexed ſoule of mine, it may through Gods mercy be pacified, this evill and corruption which harbour in me, and hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of me, it may through Gods mercy be removed.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſecond thing, how doth God ſtir up the heart of an humbled broken hearted ſinner to hope? this is worth a while a little to conſider of the ground to get and maintaine this hope may be referred to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord doth ſweetly ſtay the heart, and fully perſwade the ſoule that a mans ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, and that all his ſinnes may be pardoned, and that all the good things he wanteth, they may be beſtowed; this is a great ſuſtainer of the ſoule:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4394:381"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 59 --> hope is alwayes of a good to come; now when a poore ſinner ſeeth his ſinnes, the number of them, the nature of them, the vileneſſe of them, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of his ſoule, that he can take no reſt; he ſeeth no reſt in the creature, nor in himſelfe, though he pray all day, yet he cannot get the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of one ſinne: the ſoule is out of any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of pardon or power of mercy in any thing he hath or doth; though all meanes, all helpes, though all men and angels ſhould joyne together, yet they cannot pardon one ſinne of his, yet the Lord lifteth up his voyce, and he ſaith from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thy ſinnes are pardonable; this is a voyce a great way off, thy ſinnes may be pardoned in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Looke as a traitour, that doth apprehend the anger of the King againſt him, and that he is ſent for to be attached, hee and cry is made after him, the Purſevant purſueth him; the poore creature flieth from court to countrey, from countrey to city, and ſo to the ſea coaſt, ſeeking for ſome ſhelter; the Purſevant beſetteth the ſea coaſt for him, the poore ſoule is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in deſpaire of mercy from the Prince, hee ſeeth no hope of pardon from him; but when he overheareth a man that ſaith, in truth you had better open the doore, and yeeld your ſelfe to the King, there is hope, the poore ſoule is much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained; What, is there yet hope that my offence may bee pardoned, will the King receive mee to mercy: So when the Lord humbleth the ſoule, diſcovereth his ſinnes, maketh knowne his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, theſe are thy ſinnes that thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4394:381"/>

               <p>Secondly, This ſinne of deſperation, as it is moſt injurious to God; ſo in the ſecond place, it is extraordinary dangerous to thy owne ſoule: It is that which taketh up the bridge, and cutteth off all paſſages: and there can no ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation come into the poore ſoule of a poore ſinner: <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.15. <note place="margin">

                  <!-- orig ref value was 63 --> and unleſſe theſe bee filled, no man can ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In a word, my brethren, ſuffer me to open my ſelfe; the truth is, this deſpaire of the ſoule is that which cutteth the ſinewes of all mans comfort, and taketh off the power and edge of all the meanes of grace: it daunteth all a mans endevours, nay it plucketh up a mans endevours as it were quite by the rootes: for that which a man deſpaireth off, hee will never labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is here as with a man in pangs of death; unto ſuch a man all means are unavailable for his good, his bed will not eaſe him, meat will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him, chaſing will not revive; at the laſt, we ſay he is gone, he is a dead man: friends leave him, Phyſitians leave him, they may goe and pray for him, and mourne for him, but they cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. So this deſpaire of ſoule maketh a man caſt off all hope, and lie downe in a forlorne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, expecting no good to come: alas, ſaith a man, what skilleth for a man to pray? what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth a man to read? what benefit in all the means of grace? the truth of it is, the ſtone is rolled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and my condemnation ſealed for ever: it is ſure in heaven, and therefore I will never looke after Chriſt, grace, and ſalvation any more, and preſſe the means to him: let him come to heare the Word, marke how he caſteth off all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; it was marvellous ſeaſonable and profitable, it was the good Word of the Lord, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto ſuch as have any ſhare therein.

                  <!-- orig ref value was 63 --> ſoule, the time of grace is paſt, the day is gone, and thus the ſoule ſinketh in it ſelfe; if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would pray for him, and Miniſters would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to doe him good, why hee biddeth them ſpare their labour, for hell is his portion, and his condemnation is ſealed in heaven: ſee now and conſider what deſperate danger of deſpaire brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a poore heart, and maketh him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of mercie, that no meanes can come at him. It is a pretty paſſage of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 77.7. <hi>Will the Lord caſt me off ever? and will he ſhew no favor?</hi> I ſaid this is my infirmitie, ſaith the text, the word in the original, this is my ſicknes; as who ſhould ſay, this would be my death, what, <hi>is mercie gone for ever?</hi> then my life is gone, then is all my comfort and all my hope gone, therefore take heed of this, it taketh off the edge of our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, &amp; Gods ordinances that might do us good.</p>

Now this hope is not the hope of the Saints; the hope of the Saints is a grounded hope, but theſe hopes meerely hang upon ſome idle pleas and fooliſh pretences, and ſome carnall reaſons: but I tell you they will fall, and their hopes will ſinke, and they into the bottomeleſſe pit before they bee aware: it is the command and counſell of <hi>Peter, That every man ſhould be ready to give a reaſon of his faith and hope that is in him;</hi> therefore let us ſee the reaſons that carry you, the arguments that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to theſe groundleſſe and fooliſh hopes; you hope to be ſaved, and you hope to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and you hope to ſee the face of God with comfort: let us ſee the ground for theſe hopes of yours, good hope hath good reaſons, grounded hope grounded reaſons; you ſay, you hope to be ſaved, and have no reaſon for it; it is a fooliſh hope, an unreaſonable hope, the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Hypocrites are mainly five:</p>

                  <!-- orig ref value was 71 --> it hath a ward to hang and hold upon: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5. <hi>I wait upon the Lord, and I hope in his Word:</hi> and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>All things are written for our instruction, that through the comfort of the Scriptures wee might have hope:</hi> here is hope, not through your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, imaginations and dreames, but through the Scripture: we might have hope, a grounded hope is a Scripture hope, it is a word hope; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that cannot bring a word, and give a reaſon for their hope, I would not give a ruſh, nor a farthing token for a hundred cart load of ſuch hopes: No, it is Law hope, it is Goſpell hope, Scripture hope, Word hope; ſo that the ſoule can ſay, the Word ſaith, the Lord came to ſave thoſe that are loſt, why I finde my ſelfe to be loſt, and therefore I hope the Lord will ſeeke mee, though I cannot ſeeke him; I hope the Lord will finde me, though I cannot finde my ſelfe; I hope the Lord will ſave me, though I cannot ſave my ſelfe. But the hopes of the wicked hang like a cloud, they are not grounded upon the evidence of the Scripture, they crowd all in the generall; I hope to fare as well as others, and other had mercy, and why not I? And hence the hopes of the wicked are unſtedfaſt and wavering: but a man might here demand, are not the hopes of the Saints ſo too? Doe they not waver and ſtagger many a time? Anſwer, It is true, but with this difference; the hopes of Gods ſervants are like an anchor, which though ſometimes it is ſhaken, yet it holdeth the faſter: but the hopes of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are like the waves of the ſeas, and they

                  <!-- orig ref value was 71 --> come to nothing: <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.28. <hi>The hope of the righteous ſhall be glad, but the expectation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall periſh;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, though the waves be great, and the ſtormes violent, yet the anchor ſhall bee faſt, and the ſhip ſhall come ſafe to haven; but it is otherwiſe with the wicked, their hopes doe periſh. What is become of your hopes now? you thought you ſhould bee ſaved, and that you ſhould doe as well as others; but when the day of judgement commeth, and the laſt great day of account ſhall be, what then ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all your hopes? You ſhall ſee, it is as if a man ſhould plead for a mans inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did dwell in the ſame towne, and were of the ſame name. But now the Saints of God, when they come to lay claime to mercy, they bring a hold, a word, <hi>Iſay</hi> 61.3. <hi>He appointeth them that mourne in Sion:</hi> will you have a legacy of joy, mercy, and pitty? here it is, the Lord Chriſt left it you, I bequeath this and leave it to all you broken hearted ſinners, to all you humble mourning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Sion: this is your legacy, ſue for it in the Court, and you ſhall have it for ever.

Now when the ſoule hath waited a long time, and yet this mercy comes not, and he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels at it and ſaith, the Lord hath ſaid the weary ſoule ſhall bee refreſhed: Oh where are all thoſe precious promiſes? then the <hi>will</hi> ſends out deſire to meet with that good which will not yet come, and ſo deſire goeth wandring from one ordinance to another, till it bring Chriſt home to the ſoule. As a gentleman doth when he expects ſome noble perſonage, hee ſends out a man to wait in ſuch a place, and bring him word whether he ſeeth him or no: afterwards when he returnes and ſaith he ſeeth him not, the gentleman ſends out another meſſenger to meet him afarre off, and ſo likewiſe to bring him and give him entertainment: So it is with the ſoule of a poore ſinner in this caſe.</p>

So it is with a heart that is ſoundly deſirous after grace: it will not only take up ſome duty which God requires, but if there bee any ſervice which the Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales, or any duty the Lord commands, hee will take it up, and as hee is able ſet upon the dutie. Sometimes a man may neglect a dutie he knowes not of, but if hee be informed and convinced thereof, hee cannot but ſet about it, if hee deſires to gaine good thereby. Therefore if any man hath wronged any by falſe dealing, <hi>theeving,</hi> or <hi>pilfering;</hi> the ſervant, the maſter; the childe, the father, the chapman, the buyer, &amp;c. let that ſoule know it is his duty, and God requires it if ever he will have peace of conſcience, and the evidence of Gods love made knowne to him in the pardon of his ſinnes, that he muſt make reſtitution. We ſee <hi>Zacheus</hi> when God had opened his eyes, and given him a thorow deſire to come home and receive Chriſt, made an open proclamation; <hi>If I have wronged any man,</hi>

Beloved, this is a duty which God requires of every ſoule; and this is a way whereby thou mayeſt get ſome comfort to thy ſelfe, if thou art content to renounce thy ſinnes, and receive mercy in the pardon of them. If therefore any here preſent ſhall goe away and hide his <hi>ſtollen waters,</hi> and bee loth to reſtore that which hee hath gotten by his cheating and falſe dealing, but ſaith his eſtate will be impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and hee ſhall bee caſt behinde hand; and what will the world ſay, I ſhall quite bee ſhamed for ever: Why, if thou beeſt afraid of ſhame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thy money into the hand of ſome honeſt and faithfull Miniſter, and let him make up the matter privately. But what, doſt thou tell me of poverty? thou hadſt better be caſt behinde hand, than bee caſt into hell. Doſt thou deſire grace and mercy? Hearken what the Lord ſaith, this duty muſt bee performed, if ever thou receive mercy, ſet upon that duty then, or elſe thou ſhalt never get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy ſinnes. So now wee may ſee by theſe particulars, that the world even ſwarmes with lazy Hypocrites, and that there is but little ſound deſire after grace. How many have the meanes and will not uſe them?

                  <!-- orig ref value was 91 --> Goſpell, becauſe it is a matter of credit, and great men cannot countenance the Goſpell ſo much as the Goſpell credits them: but if thou wilt not be content to be ruled by the ſame, thou art an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous profeſſour, thou never didſt deſire Chriſt for himſelfe, but for thy owne aymes and ends, only to make a booty of Chriſt; but now a good heart, a gracious ſoule, that hath this deſire, ſet on by the Spirit powerfully and effectually, will bee content to have all Chriſt, and nothing but <hi>him</hi> in every thing he enjoyes.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Signes of a terrified Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</note> Firſt, he will be lingring and hankering after ſome corruption, he will be playing with edged tooles with the flie about the candle, and will venture farre upon thoſe occaſions that may draw him into ſinne; as a drunkard will be content to be called into an ale-houſe, that he may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tipple; but a gracious heart though hee loathes all ſinne, yet he loathes that moſt which he hath moſt loved; as an adulterer flyes from all looſe thoughts, as from a Devill, as from hell, and from all occaſions that may give way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in this hypocrite you ſhall finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly this note, hee will ſlight and ſlubber over ſome ſmaller ſinnes, as he thinkes, and ſome leſſer corruptions, and though hee bee taken aſide with ſome diſtempers, yet this and that ſervice he can doe, this and that prayer he can make, ſuch duties he can performe, that will make all whole againe. But thou hypocrite, doth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt give thee power againſt one ſin, and not againſt every ſinne? doſt thou finde one ſinne vile, and not another? thou willingly deceiveſt thine owne ſoule: for that ſoule that hath beene truly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the uglineſſe of ſinne, dares not meddle with it, but if reproofe comes, it yeelds, if any thing be amiſſe, he will reforme it, he will rather be miſerable than ſinfull.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nay, in the third place a terrified hypocrite it is marvellous what he will doe in pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for Chriſt, hee will part with any thing, hee cares not for ſhame, when men point at him, what, you turned profeſſour now? I have knowne the time you have hated and railed at ſuch, hee cares not for this, let them ſay what they will, nay, even perſecution he will ſuffer contentedly, and never ſeeke Chriſt all this while; what is the reaſon of this? why, he findes now by experience that hell fire is worſe than wild-fire; tell not mee of reproach, ſaith the poore ſoule in horrour of heart, tell mee not that men will ſcoffe at me; I had rather have wild-fire about mine eares, than hell fire upon my conſcience, any thing that will cure mee and heale mee ſhall be well-come; it is hell where I have beene, and it is horrour that hath ſeized upon my ſoule, and I had rather doe or ſuffer any thing than thus continue; and all this is for eaſe now: for horrour of conſcience is greater than all the plagues in the world, and therefore he will be content to beare that one, ſo he may be rid of the other; hee had rather bee ſhamed than plagued; rather bee baniſhed than terrified; rather impriſoned than tormented: yet onely ſeekes his owne eaſe, not a Chriſt all this while: And therefore experience hath taught us this, that many after a great deale of terrour and horrour of heart, when the pang is over, have returned, and beene as vile, and as baſe, and as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nay, haply worſe than ever they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: the reaſon is, they have gotten their deſire

                  <!-- orig ref value was 94 --> now, and they care for no more, they have gotten their eaſe and quiet now, and as for Chriſt, and grace, and holineſſe, they care no more for them, becauſe they have no more uſe of them: Nay, to goe further (obſerve it) this poore creature may in his owne ſenſe and feeling apprehend and thinke, that he doth renounce all ſinne truly, and that he puts the higheſt eſteeme and greateſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt above all things in the world; if hee looke into his owne apprehenſion, he may thinke he doth thus, and yet the union and league betweene ſinne and his ſoule was never broken, all this may bee in ſenſe and feeling, and an honeſt Miniſter, if he be not very wiſe in charitie, will judge ſo, as ſhall appeare by this inſtance: Take water ſeething hot, though in nature it is the coldeſt of all elements, yet while it continueth on the fire, it growes ſo hot, that a man ſhall feele no cold at all in it, but yet there is a principle of cold remaining in it (as the Philoſopher conceives) for plucke the fire from the water, or the water from the fire, and it will returne to coldneſſe againe, and freeze the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe when it is taken from the fire, it beats out the heat with the more violence: Now the reaſon why the cold was there, and yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was, becauſe the fierceneſſe of the heat did over-maſter it, and made it retire, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it ſelfe in outward appearance. So it is with this terrified <hi>hypocrite</hi> in theſe pangs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, and horrours of conſcience, when the ſoule is poſſeſſed with the fierce indignation of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4394:414"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 94 --> the Almightie, when the flaſhes of everlaſting vengeance ſeize upon the heart of a ſinner; this takes off the pleaſure, delight and content, which the heart had in ſinne: though the ſoule love it, and the heart embrace it, and the ſpirit cloſe with it, yet he can find and feele in his owne apprehenſion no pleaſure at all in ſinne, nor no ſweetneſſe in his luſts, by reaſon of the dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vengeance of the Lord, which takes off all the pleaſantneſſe that was in it before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the adulterer that hath his dalliances every morning, if God let the flames of his vengeance once into his ſoule, as hee hath flamed in luſt, all his ſweetneſſe and delight in ſin will vaniſh away in his owne apprehenſion, but yet his ſoule cleaves to his baſe luſts ſtill, and his heart is knit to them, and the league and combination betweene ſinne and his ſoule was never broken and parted. So that by this we may ſee, why a ſinner in his owne apprehenſion may thinke hee hath no delight in ſinne, and yet there is a league betweene ſinne and the ſoule ſtill, and this Hypocrite may thus continue all the while the ſound of the ſtroke is upon him. If haply his affections be ſtirring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſinne, then ſaith conſcience, You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what was done before, you remember what you did ſuch and ſuch a time; would you fain be in hell againe? I will arreſt you for this one day (ſaith conſcience) and ſo his ſoule flieth off from his curſed diſtempers, not that the union between ſinne and his ſoule is broken, but onely his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions for the preſent are abated for acting.

               <p>Suffer mee to expreſſe a paſſage or two this way: the extremity of Gods indignation is a farre greater evill than all the good things in the world can be comfortable; it is a farre greater evill than any thing here below, better to bee in beggery, better to bee in priſon, better to bee perſecuted, than to be tormented, than to be ſet upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall wracke by the horrour of conſcience: Now as the indignation of the Lord is a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment than theſe; ſo the eaſe from this is a greater good than can proceed from the things here below, the eaſe is anſwerably good, as the indignation is evill.

Know therefore that deſires and loves are of a double nature, ſome in vocation are obſerved, ſome in ſanctification are conſidered, as there was a ſorrow in preparation, &amp; a ſorrow in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſo there is one deſire and love and joy in vocation ſtirred, another in ſanctification expreſſed, both joyne one with another, but they are not the ſame. The frame of the heart, and the worke upon the ſoule in vocation, is not the ſame which is in ſanctification. Briefly, in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this call which I ſpeake of, the Lord worketh this worke upon me, I have no power of my ſelfe, but onely receive it from the Lord. At the firſt conveying in of the power of hope, and deſire, and love, and joy, God communicates them unto me, but in ſanctification I worke from a principle which I have received from the power of grace, which Chriſt hath communicated to me being called, and ſanctified, and having received the Spirit of Adoption: So that the graces I now ſpeake of, uſher in and lead the way for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of faith; when faith comes into the ſoul,

Now the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleare, if you meet with hope and faith, love and faith put for one another, underſtand that they are not literally to bee conceived, but in a figurative ſenſe.

So that all other love and joy which is not ſpirituall and from him, cannot be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Majeſty.

                  <hi>They which are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> So all the joy and love (as well as any other action) that proceeds out of nature and fleſh cannot pleaſe God: But it muſt be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly love and joy, proceeding from the Spirit: Suffer me to expreſſe my ſelfe after this manner Looke as it is with a gentleman in the countrey, he will bee content to leave his habitation for a while, and give up his houſe to the <hi>King</hi> for a while, becauſe hee is but a meane man, and not able to entertaine ſo great a retinue; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King ſends his owne proviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand; (obſerve it.)

This laſt clauſe is added to diſcover the difference, and to make knowne the diſtinct nature of this love and joy here, from all the fained and falſe love and joy, which hypocrites pretend to have, and ſeeme to expreſſe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore I ſay this love and joy is kindled not onely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him, and rejoyce in him; for there is a kinde of entertaining and rejoycing in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. <hi>Iudas</hi> had a haile Maſter, and the common people ſpread their garments, and welcomed Chriſt, crying <hi>Hoſanna, bleſſed is hee that commeth in the Name of the moſt High;</hi> and the young man pretended a deare affection to Chriſt, <hi>Master, I will follow thee whither ſoever thou goeſt;</hi> And the <hi>ſtony ground received the word with joy,</hi>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4394:428"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 108 --> joyes in a thing, cannot but love that he rejoyceth in: So that wee ſee all theſe had a kinde of joy, but it is not that kinde of joy that comes from the Father, neither will it carry it ſelfe beſeeming the riches of Gods mercy; for hee that ſaluted his Maſter <hi>All haile,</hi> in concluſion <hi>betrayed him:</hi> is this your joy and love you entertaine Chriſt withall? So that young man that would <hi>follow</hi> him <hi>whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he went,</hi> preſently forſooke him: And they that even now cried <hi>Hoſanna, Hoſanna,</hi> bleſſed be hee that commeth in the Name of the Higheſt, anon crye as faſt, crucifie him, crucifie him; and they that received the Word with joy, when temptation and perſecution came, rejected it: This joy is a fooliſh imagination hammered out of their Anvill, for baſe ends and by aimes; but they carry not themſelves beſeeming the riches of Gods mercy revealed to them. For, <hi>Hee that loveth father or mother, or brother or ſister, more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour: that is, hee that priſeth any thing more, and delights in any thing more than Chriſt, is not worthy of him. Therefore whoſoever he be that beſtowes his love and joy more upon any thing in this world, than upon Chriſt; it is not a love and joy beſeeming him, nor brought from heaven, but proceeds from a baſe rotten heart, and will faile us, and bring no profit nor comfort in the end. This then ſufficeth for the ſenſe, and proofe of the point; we come now to open it a little; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for explication, and confirmation thereof, wee will handle theſe two things: Firſt wee will

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we will diſcover the motives and grounds what it is in the promiſe that will kindle and ſtrike fire, and inflame theſe two affections, and bring them to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons.</note> you will ſay how comes love and joy next after hope and deſire? I anſwer, you muſt know there is no more but two affections in the ſoule, God infinitely wiſe having ſo framed it, and theſe two are hope and deſire. The underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſaith ſuch a thing is profitable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if I had it, then hope is ſent out to wait for that goodneſſe, and if it comes not, then deſire the ſecond affection is ſent out to meet the good; hope ſtands and waits for it, but deſire wanders up and downe, ſeeking and enquiring after a Lord Jeſus, and goeth from coaſt to coaſt, from Eaſt to Weſt; Oh that I could, and oh that I might, and when ſhall I, and how may I come to the ſpeech of a Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As it was with the Spouſe in the Canticles, when her beloved was gone, ſhe wandred up and downe, ſeeking of him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the watchmen if they did not ſee him: ſo deſire wanders from this thing to that thing, from this place to that place, and never ceaſeth, to ſee if it can gaine notice of Chriſt: It goeth to prayer to ſee if that will intreat a Chriſt: It goeth to the Word to ſee if that will reveale him: It goeth to conference to ſee if he can heare of a Chriſt there: then it commeth to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the Sacrament, to ſee if it can heare

                  <!-- orig ref value was 109 --> any newes of a Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of mercie; and the ſoule thus continues wandring and ſeeking, till at laſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt comes into the ſoule, when the ſoule hath hungred and longed for him. At length the Lord is pleaſed to ſhew himſelfe in view: behold thy King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; ſo the Lord ſaith, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away thy ſinnes:</hi> Oh thou poore broken hearted ſinner, here is thy Saviour, hee is come downe from heaven to ſpeake peace to thy ſoule in the pardon of thy ſinnes; thou that hungreſt for a Chriſt, here he is to ſatisfie thee; thou that thirſteſt for a Chriſt, hee is now come to refreſh thee; thou that haſt long ſought him, hee ſaith, here I am, and all my merits are thine. Now when the Lord Jeſus is pleaſed to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſoule; now deſire hath met with the Lord: there are two other affections ſent out by the Spirit to entertaine Chriſt, and they are love and joy. Suffer me (I beſeech you) to expreſſe my ſelfe after this manner, that I may diſcover the frame and guiſe of Gods Spirit in this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke.</p>
               <p>It is in this caſe with a ſinner, as it is with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour or traitour (obſerve what I ſay) who is purſued with a Purſevant, and is fled to the ſea coaſts, and hath taken a hold, and he is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. And now hee ſeeth there is no hope of favour, nor no hope of eſcape; therefore hee is even content to ſubmit to the Kings pleaſure, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Simile.</note> and yeelds his neck to the block, that hee may receive puniſhment for his offence. Now comming to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:4394:429"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 109 --> execution, he heares an inckling from the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, there is yet hope that this man may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; with that the poore malefactour in the tower, his heart is ſtirred up to hope: Nay then he heares another meſſenger from the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſay, if he will come unto the Court and ſeek unto his Majeſty, and importune his Grace for mercy and favour, it is like he ſhall be pardoned: this is the ſecond voyce: one ſaith thou mayeſt be pardoned, the other ſaith, nay if thou wilt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt be pardoned. Then hee makes haſte, and deſire carries him to the Court, to ſue for favour from the King: So that he will bee continually there, liſtning and enquiring of every one, ſaying, did you heare the King ſpeake nothing of mee, how ſtands the Kings minde towards mee, I pray how goes my caſe? then ſome tells him, the truth is, the King heares you are humbled, and you ſory for it, you are like to heare more newes hereafter. At laſt the King lookes out of the window, and ſeeth the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour and ſaith, is this the traitour? they ſay yes, this is the man thar is humbled and intreats for mercy, and deſires nothing ſo much as favour. The King tells him the truth is his pardon is drawing, and comming towards him: with that his heart leaps in his belly, and his heart is inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his Majeſty; and he ſaith, God bleſſe your Majeſty, never was there ſuch a favourable Prince to a poore traitour. His heart leaps with joy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his pardon is comming towards him; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not ſealed yet: Now when it is ſealed and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4394:430"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 110 --> all, the King calls him in and delivers it, and that is the laſt ſtroke of faith.</p>
               <p>So it is with a poore ſinner, hee is this malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: you that have committed high treaſon, you thinke not of it, but take heed, God will purſue you one day; haply the Lord lets you alone for the preſent, but he will ſurprize you on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and conſcience will pluck thee by the throat, and carry thee downe to Hell. And now the Lord purſueth him with heavie and terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and lets flie at his face, and ſets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a worke as Purſevant, and that ſaith, theſe are thy ſinnes, and to hell thou muſt goe, God hath ſet me to execute thy ſoule. Now the poore ſoule ſeeth hee can by no means eſcape from the Lord, and to purchaſe any favour he ſees it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; therefore he is reſolved to lie downe at Gods feet, and ſaith, I confeſſe Lord, there is but one way, let me be damned, ſo thou maiſt be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. If the Lord will ſhew favour, ſo it is; but he cannot deſire it almoſt, becauſe he hath ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him. Now comes the great voyce, he heares a noyſe afarre off by the miniſtery of the Goſpell, thy ſinnes are pardonable: with this the ſoule lookes up, and hope ſtirres the heart, and ſaith, then it may be a damned creature may bee ſaved, then it may be a <hi>dead dogge</hi> may live, and a traytor may be pardoned: Then the ſoule heares another voyce, if thou canſt ſee the excellency of mercy and long for it, and ſeeke after it, thou ſhalt be pardoned. Why, goe then, ſaith Deſire, and he fills heaven and earth with his cries, and his

Now the Miniſters of God that underſtand the frame of the heart aright, will ſay, The Lord heares you are an humble ſinner, and that you long for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and lye at the court gate, and will not away without mercie; wee heare, God intends well towards you, you ſhall heare more hereafter: thus farre now deſire goeth.</p>
               <p>At laſt, Chriſt preſents himſelfe to the ſinner, and ſpeakes to his ſoule by the miniſterie of the Word, he lookes downe from heaven, and gives him a ſweet looke of mercie, and that makes his heart leape againe, and that is done in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (for ſtill underſtand that God doth it by the miniſterie of the Word, doe not now looke for any ſtrange dreames or miraculous imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the Lord ſpeakes by his Word, and ſaith, thou haſt a broken heart, thou haſt longed for my ſalvation, goe thy wayes, I have heard thoſe prayers of thine, and obſerved thoſe endevours of thine, and thy pardon is granted, bee it to thee as thou haſt deſired, and thy pardon ſhall afterward bee ſealed and delivered. Now when the Lord tels the ſoule, It is done, it wants only ſealing and delivering, the heart of a poore ſinner, when it findes ſome comfort and refreſhment from the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4394:431"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 111 --> Lord in the word, he ſaith, The Miniſter ſaid I was the ſinner, and God intends good to me, and that my ſinnes are pardoned: as the Prince ſaith, <hi>Fiat,</hi> let it be done; ſo the Lord ſaith, Mercie is comming towards thee, and mercie is granted to thee: Now the heart leapes with joy, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord, let my ſoule bleſſe him for ever: How ought I to bleſſe that God that hath done ſo great things for my poore ſoule? What, I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? and what, my ſinnes forgiven? what, is the pardon granted, and now ſealing, onely it wants delivering? why then if I never ſee more of it, but goe downe to hell, yet this is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that I have ſeene a ſmile from God, this makes my heart leape within me, though I burne in hell for ever; this is the next voice.</p>
               <p>Now that brings in love and joy: See a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage this way, <note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  <!-- orig ref value was 112 --> obſerve the baſeneſſe of my courſe now, which before I never conſidered; and I am aſhamed of my former abuſe of Gods grace revealed; I am even confounded in regard of the abominations which my ſoule hath harboured; this is the mourning of a poore ſinner: Now marke Gods anſwer, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is my deare ſonne, hee is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant childe, for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I doe earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercie upon him. The Lord kindled the fire of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in his heart, and ſpake bitter things againſt his conſcience, yet hee remembred him all the while; as who ſhould ſay, I obſerved all thoſe deſires, and conſidered all thoſe teares, and heard all thoſe prayers, and tooke notice of all thoſe complaints; and my bowels earne towards a poore ſinner that deſires my mercie in Chriſt, and the truth is, I will ſhew mercie to him: thus wee ſee the behaviour of God to the ſoule, as alſo the behaviour of the ſoule to God: and thus you ſee the order of the affections; when God is abſent, hope waits for it, and deſire longs after it; when the good is in view, love entertaines it, and joy delights, and ſports, and playeth with it: love is like the Hoſt that welcomes the gueſt, and joy is like the chamberlaine that attends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and is very ready and pleaſing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the promiſe, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: this is the very guiſe of the heart, as I conceive.</p>

I beſeech you, marke it, when the Lord doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his favour and goodneſſe in that ſame powerfull manner unto a heart humbled, longing for his favour, that it doth force the ſoule to bee affected with it, and doth prevaile with the ſoule, and by a holy kinde of might prevaileth, and makes the ſoule to be affected with the relliſh of his favour; this is the ground: A poſſible good ſtirres up hope, a neceſſarie excellencie in that good ſetleth deſire, and a relliſh in that good ſetled, kindles love: So that in the promiſe there is a fulneſſe to take up the whole frame of the heart. The phraſe is admirable in the Pſalmes; <hi>The Lord ſhall command his loving kindneſſe in the morning;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.18.</note> (a ſtrange paſſage) it is a phraſe taken from Kings, and Princes, and great Commanders, whoſe word is a law. So that the Lord ſhall ſend forth his loving kindneſſe with a command; as if he ſhould ſay, Goe love and everlaſting kindneſſe, take thy commiſſion, and I charge thee, goe to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4394:433"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 113 --> the poore humble ſinner, goe to the poore, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and thirſtie ſinner, goe and proſper and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, and ſettle my love upon his heart, whether he will or no, and let my kindneſſe be ſetled upon his ſoule that hath longed for it. Experience tels us this, the Lord doth by an Almightineſſe give a charge, and put a commiſſion into loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hands, that hee ſhall doe good to a poore ſoule, even then when hee ſinkes under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his ſinnes, and under the apprehenſion of his weakneſſe. What, ſhall I have mercie? No, no. Will the Lord Jeſus Chriſt accept me? No ſurely. Could I pray ſo, and had I thoſe parts, and could I performe duties after this and this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then there were ſome hope; but, alas! there is no mercie for me. But hearken, I beſeech you, what the word diſcovers your eſtate to be; is it thus and thus with you? yes; then I ſpeake from the Lord, mercie is yours, and heaven is yours; No, no, ſaith the ſoule, I cannot beleeeve it, ſuch a wretch as I goe to heaven? No, heaven ſhall rather fall than I come there. Thus the diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſinner knocks off mercie, and ſhuts the doore againſt it. Now when all carnall reaſonings, and high imaginations (as <hi>Paul</hi> cals them) have raiſed up ſtrong holds againſt mercie and comfort, when the word cannot doe it for the preſent, God is faine at laſt to command loving kindneſſe, and ſend him with a commiſſion from heaven, ſaying, I charge you, breake open the doore of the heart of ſuch a ſinner, rend that veile of ignorance, and teare that curſed veile of carnall reaſoning; And
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4394:433"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 113 --> I command thee, goe to that ſoule, and cheare it, and comfort it; goe to that ſoule, and refreſh it, and fill it; tell him his ſinnes are pardoned, his perſon accepted, and his ſoule ſhall be ſaved; tell him his ſighs and groanes are heard, and his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers obſerved in heaven; make this good to his ſoule, I charge you, before you come backe againe; this is the admirable goodneſſe of the Lord; the ſoule many times hath ſo many trickes, and ſhifts, and windings, and yeeldings to carnall reaſon, that no comfort will come in; So that the Lord is faine to ſend loving kindneſſe to cheare the ſoule: As it is with ſome unruly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who will not give a man poſſeſſion of his right, till the high Sheriffe comes, and gives him poſſeſſion by force whether they will or no: So loving kindneſſe is Gods high Sheriffe; now when a company of baſe fellowes, as carnall reaſonings, and the like, would keepe out mercie and favour that is due to a ſinner, the Lord commands loving kindneſſe to breake open the doore, and ſpeake comfort to him: and now take notice of what I ſay, as a good to come was the ground of hope, and if there be any neceſſarie excellencie, deſire longs for it: So when the good is not only preſent, but expreſſeth his preſence, and leaves ſome kinde of remembrance, as it were, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelfe in ſome manner effectually to the ſoule; that ſtirres up love continually, and that muſt be done before any love can be kindled. (I open it thus:) Looke as it is with touching, which is a facultie of nature, if the thing lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <!-- orig ref value was 114 --> a man, leaves a ſtrong impreſſion upon him, then a mans touch will feele it; but if it be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light, then it may lye upon a man, and be preſent with him, and yet not be perceived: as a feather, lay it upon a mans finger on the ſudden, or a mote in a mans face, becauſe it leaves no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, hee feeles it not; but if there bee any weight laid upon his hand, then he feeles: ſo if it be water that moiſtens him, or fire that ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him, he is ſenſible of it; ſo love in the ſoule is like touching in the body: now when loving kindneſſe is not ſet on upon the heart, though it be preſent with the ſoule, yet becauſe it leaves no impreſſion upon the ſoule, hence it comes that the heart cannot be ſtirred with any love towards it, nor be touched and affected with it, nor returne that joy and delight as becomes the favour of God. So that there muſt be the love of God, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome ſweet intimations into the heart, and expreſſing it ſelfe to the ſoule, and affecting the heart therewith; and then our love comes to bee kindled towards God againe; Gods love ſetling upon the ſoule, drawes and puls our love to God againe.</p>

               <p>It was this that kindled the frozen heart of <hi>Saul,</hi> he had a heart almoſt as cold as ice, and yet this did worke upon him.

Oh how many ſweet motions hath the Lord let into my ſoule, that he might plucke mee from my baſe courſes and ſinfull practices: but I have flowen in the face of his bleſſed Spirit. If I had lien in a dungeon, and had beene plagued with torments all my life time; yea though I had another world of miſery to live in, it is infinite mercy, ſo the Lord would paſſe by theſe baſe dealings, and pardon theſe rebellions of mine. But that God ſhould ſend his Sonne to love mee, ſo incomparably, ſo unconceivably, that I could not hate him ſo much as he loved me; I could not ſo exceed in unkindneſſe towards him, as he hath exceeded in kindneſſe towards mee.

Firſt then it is a ground of inſtruction, which I deſire to preſſe unto you, becauſe it is both ſeaſonable and profitable. From the former Doctrine therefore wee collect and conclude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably; that there is no ſufficiency in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heart, to be carried to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or to the worke of grace: wee have not this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth give it unto us: nay we cannot move towards God, or be carried in the leaſt kind to love or delight in him further than the Lord will carry us himſelfe, and beare up our hearts by the hand of his Spirit. It is true (and wee finde it by wofull experience) it is in our power to love the world, it is in our power to delight in our luſts: Nay being but naturall men, it cannot be but that we ſhould love our ſelves, and love our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and our eaſe, and profit, and applauſe in the world. There is enough of this fooliſh wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, there is enough of this carnall ſelfe-love in every mans heart.

                  <!-- orig ref value was 117 --> him, this is a worke of grace, which groweth not in our gardens: there is not one ſparke of this holy fire and ſpiritual delight in our hearts. Nay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not buy it, nor borrow it, nor receive it from any creature under Heaven, further than the <hi>Father</hi> ſends downe ſome beames of his love to kindle this in us, further than the bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is pleaſed to blow theſe ſparkes when they are kindled, further than the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the power of his merits, to feed theſe ſparkes of love thus blowne in our ſoules. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible, that any man in his naturall eſtate ſhould be ſo deluded, as to thinke hee can love the Lord or delight in him. <note place="margin" type="runSum">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14. opened.</note> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us plainly, hee <hi>was a perſecutor, and a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and injurious: Paul</hi> could doe this, and thou haply canſt doe this; thou canſt be a blaſphemer againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and thou canſt be a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Jeſus Chriſt; but <hi>Paul</hi> cannot beleeve in Chriſt, nor love the Lord Ieſus; how comes hee to this?

But how comes this, that the grace of the Lord was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in faith and love? Why, it is in Chriſt, ſaith the text; from Chriſt this faith was rooted, from Chriſt this love was kindled: As if he had ſaid, I could perſecute, and blaſpheme, and deſpiſe,

                  <!-- orig ref value was 118 --> and caſt off God and his grace, I was a wretch, a villaine, that I could doe: But that I ſhould love the Lord being injurious, and that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Lord being unfaithfull, this was from Chriſt alone. In experience we finde it, the ball muſt firſt fall upon the ground, before it can bound up againe, and returne from the ground: So the Lord Jeſus muſt dart in, and fling in this love of his into the ſoule, before the ſoule can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in love and joy backe to him againe. We muſt <hi>receive the Spirit of love</hi> from God, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</note> before the Lord can receive any ſpirituall and holy love from us.

But, ſay they, as for the ſoundneſſe of our love to the Lord Jeſus, wee defie any man in the world that ſpeakes againſt us; they finde no difficulty in the matter to love the Lord, they are certainly perſwaded they doe that.

Oh poore ſilly creature, it is a great argument that thou never hadſt this love to God, becauſe thou ſaweſt no hardneſſe to get it. It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou never didſt expreſſe any delight in Chriſt, becauſe thou thinkeſt it an eaſie matter to delight in him. Moſt men thinke it a matter of nothing; what, not love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? why, who cannot love Chriſt? Who cannot? I ſay, neither thou, nor I, nor any man under heaven can love Chriſt by any power in himſelfe: Nay let me ſpeake peremptorily, thou art as able to ſave thy owne ſoule, nay thou art as able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thy ſoule without Chriſt, as thou art able (unleſſe the Lord by the Almightie helpe of his Spirit-inable thee) to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Nay marke what I ſay, you that love Chriſt, and yet doe nothing for him, but pretend great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inwardly, how ever you expreſſe not your ſelves in outward appearance; I tell thee, if a man might have happineſſe by it, if he might have heaven laid downe upon the naile (as wee ſay) if he could love Chriſt, I ſay, upon theſe conditions, if thou haſt but nature in thee, thou wouldſt never goe to heaven, thou wouldſt never be happie.

It is not an eaſie matter to love the Lord Jeſus; the Father from heaven muſt learne you that; you muſt goe to another manner of ſchoole, than ever you have beene at yet, if ever you learne this lecture: thou mayſt pray till thy eyes ſinke in thy head, and till thy heart failes; and yet thou canſt not love Chriſt, unleſſe the Spirit inable thee thereunto. Thinke of this, you that thinke it is nothing to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If it were nothing but to talke of love, and to complement with the Lord Jeſus, to make a curſie to Chriſt, and to make a leg to the Lord, and yet hate him inwardly, then it were an eaſie matter indeed; it is nothing to buckle to him in this faſhion, and in the meane time oppoſe him, and the power of his grace: but to entertaine and welcome a Saviour, ſutable and agreeable to the worth of him, this nature will not, cannot doe, it is the worke of the Lord.</p>

                  <!-- orig ref value was 124 --> and ſo I might inſtance in a thouſand examples of the like nature: Whereas now (marke what I ſay) that love which is wrought from God, alwayes drawes the ſoule unto Gods love againe, the Lord lets downe the cords of his love into the ſoule, and thereby breeds love, and kindles love in the ſoule, to that goodneſſe and kindneſſe of his; and this is the excellencie of a Chriſtian, and this love is of a right coine, and of a right ſtampe: but love of my parts, that Chriſt may glorifie my parts; and love of profit, that Chriſt might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote my profit: I love my parts and profit only now, and not Chriſt in this caſe: and this is the greateſt difference betweene the love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which the cunningſt hypocrite under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can have, and the Saints of God: I expreſſe it thus; Meat that a man takes downe inwardly, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Simile.</note> and digeſts, breeds good bloud, and good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; but that which a man takes, and digeſts not, but vomits out againe preſently, breeds nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good bloud, nor good complexion: So it is with the love of the heart that is rightly wrought upon, to entertaine and love a Saviour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him, and welcome him, as beſeemes his worth: a heart that is foundly wrought upon by the Spirit, feeds heartily upon the promiſe, and that feeding and taking downe of the promiſe, and that cloſing with the promiſe, breeds good bloud and good complexion; true love that breeds good bloud, and true joy that breeds good complexion, becauſe the promiſe is fed upon: it is the worke of Gods Spirit which ſeize upon,

But now hee which entertaines a Noble man after a noble manner, and he which entertaines a King after a kingly manner, labours to give him all content, hee will not pleaſe himſelfe, nor fulfill his owne minde, but ſtudies how hee may give content to the <hi>Noble man,</hi> or to the <hi>King.</hi> Nay it is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee what men of great place will doe in this caſe: When they entertaine a <hi>King,</hi> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will bee ſervants while the <hi>King</hi> is there; haply hee is a man of great eſtate, and hath many to attend upon him, yet hee gives charge to his ſervants, I care not what becomes of me, but bee ſure let his <hi>Majesty</hi> be pleaſed; and if any comes to ſpeake with him, hee tels him hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ſpeake with him now, hee muſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4394:448"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 128 --> attend upon his <hi>Majeſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is betweene a ſound faithfull loving ſoule that entertaines Chriſt, and an Hypocrite; the one receives Chriſt into his ſoule as a <hi>ſervant</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his family, and all the while Gods Goſpell or Grace may promote his honour, or eaſe, or credit, ſo farre as theſe may ſerve his turne, ſo farre as profit, and honour, and riches come in by this means, welcome Goſpell, and welcome Chriſt: But if he ſees danger will come, or inconvenience befall, or miſery betide; then he turnes Goſpell, and Chriſt, and profeſſion, and all out of doores, becauſe hee entertained the Goſpell onely as a <hi>ſervant</hi> to content himſelfe. But hee that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines Chriſt and the Goſpell, as a <hi>King</hi> into his ſoule, labours to give him all content, he will not pleaſe himſelfe, or his luſts, or his pride or vaine glory, or any thing in the world: Nay when Chriſt comes once to be received into the ſoule, he which before had his retinue, and all to attend upon him; they muſt all ſerve Chriſt now, nay he will not give Chriſt diſtaſte in the leaſt thing, he cares for no honour now, but to honour <hi>him,</hi> he cares for no advancement now, but to advance him, he eſteems of no riches now, but ſo farre as they may credit the Goſpell: Nay to goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they that were his neereſt and deereſt friends, if they come and deſire his company, he tels them no, he cannot, the Lord Ieſus muſt bee pleaſed, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt bee contented: Nay his old luſts, and his old acquaintance, his old baſe haunts of heart, and his old ſinfull courſes,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4394:449"/>
                  <!-- orig ref value was 129 --> that have beene at inward league with his ſoule, though they come and plead for acceptance, the poore ſinner regards none of all theſe, he reſpects Chriſt onely: Nay he will diſpleaſe a faſhion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he will diſpleaſe Chriſt; he will diſpleaſe all the great men under Heaven, rather than hee will diſpleaſe Chriſt. Nay all that ſame glory and pride of his which hath beene ſo much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him, the ſoule that hath beene truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and brought to an apprehenſion of Gods goodneſſe, will rather diſpleaſe that than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is an entertainment that beſeemes the Lord, and this is the guiſe that beſeemes him which gives contentment to a Saviour: You muſt now and then receive the <hi>Goſpell</hi> when it pleaſeth you, and anon fling out the Lord Ieſus, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhly behave your ſelves towards him; but you muſt give all content unto him, and beſtow all attendance upon him. It is admirable to ſee what love will doe, how men will ſquare their mindes and hearts to the mindes of thoſe that are tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them; they will be where they pleaſe, doe what they will, <note place="margin">

But ſee a patterne of love, and a bleſſed mirrour of a heart inlarged with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: When <hi>David</hi> was <hi>anointed</hi> to the crown, and <hi>Saul</hi> purſued him heavily, and thought to defeat him of the Kingdome, and dealt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and cruelly with him; <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.17.</note> Now <hi>Ionathan</hi> meets him after an heavy affliction, and labours to cheer up the heart of <hi>David,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Feare not, for the hand of Saul ſhall not finde thee, thou ſhalt bee King over Iſrael, and I ſhall bee next unto thee:</hi> A man would thinke, why ſhould not <hi>Ionathan</hi> rather la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the crowne himſelfe, hee was next <hi>heire</hi> apparant thereunto; hee might have ſaid, <hi>Saul</hi> is my father, and why ſhould not I ſucceed him in the crowne? why ſhould <hi>David</hi> ſtart in before me? No, this comforted his heart, and rejoyced and cheered his ſoule, <hi>David ſhall bee King, and I ſhall bee next unto him;</hi> hee loved <hi>David</hi> dearly, and therefore this refreſhed him, thou ſhalt bee King in Iſrael, and it is the comfort of my heart,

                  <!-- orig ref value was 130 --> that I ſhall be next unto thee. As who ſhould ſay, it contents me more that thou ſhalt be honoured, than if I my ſelfe were honoured.</p>
               <p>So it is with a good heart that loves Ieſus Chriſt, and his Grace, and his Goſpell: Oh, the happineſſe of the Goſpell, and the promotion thereof, is the greateſt good and comfort that can befall him. The Chriſtian ſaith, let God bee honoured, though I bee diſparaged, it skils not: Is the Lord advanced, and doth his Goſpell thrive? Is his Glory promoted? Doth the worke of grace goe forward? It is enough, what becomes of my honour, or parts, or liberty, or caſe, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let it goe well with the Goſpell, and let ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be given to the Lord Ieſus in the uſe of the means, and ordinances which he hath beſtowed upon us; let Gods cauſe finde that acceptance amongſt his ſervants which it ought, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it rejoyceth my heart. See this in <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> when Chriſt began to ſet forth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and to baptize, and many came unto him; the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> grudged at it, and ſaid unto <hi>Iohn,</hi>

As if they had ſaid, Maſter, there is one now that carries all before him, every mans eye is towards him, and every mans heart is after him. Now <hi>Iohn</hi> loved Chriſt, and marke how he replies, <hi>He that hath the Bride, is the Bridegroome, but the friend

                     <!-- orig ref value was 130 --> of the bridegroome, which ſtandeth and heareth, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth greatly, becauſe of the bridegroomes voice, this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Chriſt is the Bridegroome, I am but the friend of the Bridegroome, who labour only to prepare hearts for Chriſt. Is the Lord honoured? Is the Lords worke proſpered? if this bee ſo my joy is full, I have enough; let the Lord increaſe, though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; let the Lord have the praiſe that is due unto him, and what ever befals me, I care not.</p>
               <p>This alſo was that of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> when he was dealt falſly with, and ſome falſe reports had beene ſuggeſted to <hi>David</hi> againſt him, he was content to put up all the wrong; and when <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in peace, and hee ſaw the Kings face, and that he had gained the day, and got the field: <hi>David</hi> began to comfort and refreſh him, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.30.</note> and bade him divide the land which hee had taken from him, betweene <hi>Ziba</hi> and him: now marke how hee replieth, <hi>Let him take all, for as much as the King is come againe in peace to his owne houſe:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, as for the land it skils not; as for my ſelfe, and the field, and my life, I paſſe not; for as much as you my King are come home in peace, it is enough, it is ſufficient that I have ſeene your Majeſtie in peace; this was better to him, than the field, or any thing elſe, whatſoever could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him.</p>
               <p>Beloved, many a man is all a mort, becauſe his honour fals to the ground, and becauſe his credit lies in the duſt; but if he may have his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credit, he is not troubled, though Chriſt

               <p>Brethren, ſuch are the baſe diſpoſitions of too too many amongſt us, they can tread upon Chriſts ſhoulders, and lift up him, that they may appeare above him; they can labour to lift up Gods Goſpell, that they may lift up themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: this is a baſe diſpoſition, that harbours in the heart of moſt men: but (I beſeech you) lye downe in the duſt, and be content that the Lord may be advanced, though thou be diſgraced; be content that the Lords name may bee praiſed, though thou be diſhonoured: what though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans mouth be againſt thee? and every mans hand oppoſit unto thee? yet if God be honoured, let that comfort thee: nay if any of Gods people advance God more than thy ſelfe, rejoyce in it: and let this be the aime of all our endevours for ever.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4394:144"/> ſorts.

I ſhall hardly peruſe any of theſe at this time, I will onely touch the ſecond a little, which I thinke to bee ſeaſonable, and that is the wrangling hypocrite: There are a company of wretched men in the world that fawn and flatter, and pretend to doe great kindneſſes, and they profeſſe they are at your command to ſerve you, to doe what you will, and performe what you pleaſe; but trie them and prove them, and you ſhall finde it otherwiſe, they will not openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they will not doe the thing, but when all comes to all, they pretend theſe and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences will follow if they ſhould doe it: they will not profeſſely ſay they will not doe the kindneſſe, but they will make a plea that they ought not, that they ſhould not doe it, and it is againſt reaſon that you ſhould require it: ſo theſe Hypocrites they reſolve to live no longer, they reſolve that they would not enjoy any thing in this world, they would not bee any thing, or doe any thing, but onely ſo farre as the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus may be honoured, and his Goſpell promoted: If they thinke they ſhould promote the Goſpell of Chriſt more another way than this, they would not undertake it: but when it comes to this paſſe that a man muſt leave his honour, and livings, and profits, which ſo neerly concerne him, for Chriſt, then (his tricke is this) hee doth not profeſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y ſay, I will have pleaſure or profit and not Chriſt,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4394:144"/> but he will wrangle with Chriſt, and ſtand upon tearmes with God, and ſay, hee ought not to doe this, it is not fit he ſhould doe it, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the thing. Beloved, it is admirable to obſerve the ſpirit of theſe men when the word comes cleere to them, when the duty is revealed and required at their hands; Oh how they will ſearch farre and neere to invent arguments, to make it no duty, and turne over all bookes, and (as he ſpake wittily) rake the Devils skull, that ſo they may have ſome ſhift not to doe that which they ought. It is a pretty trick to bee obſerved amongſt great men that follow the faſhion. Firſt, they reſolve to conforme themſelves to the Word of God revealed, but when the faſhion comes up, they will plead for that too: and now the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not what they muſt doe, but what they will doe; for all faſhions muſt bee lawfull, becauſe they are reſolved to uſe them. I will propound one truth onely to theſe men (obſerve it in thine owne ſoule) doe not thinke to wrangle out the truth, and to quarrell with the Goſpell, or to make any pretence againſt that way which God hath chalked out before thee, and againſt any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God commands thee: But art thou in good earneſt, content that that ſhould bee true which God will have to bee true?

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4394:148"/> the will of man is as farre averſe from God, as the minde is blinde, nay it is more averſe from God than the minde is blinde, and it is more hard to be framed: therefore there muſt be this effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall perſwading, as the underſtanding muſt have the truth cleered to ſee a Chriſt, ſo the will muſt be perſwaded, that it may receive power from him: as it is with the ſea and the thames, there is ebbing and flowing; now the natutall Philoſophers obſerve, that the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes not from any inward proper principle of it ſelfe, but the light and heat of the moone leaves its beames upon the water, and drawes the water after it; this makes it to flow, and when the moone is gone, the water returnes backe againe, and this is ebbing: juſt ſo it is with the ſoule of a man humbled and enlightened, there is no power in the ſoule to goe any further than it ſelfe, to flow unto a Chriſt, and to goe towards the promiſes, further than the Lord lets in, by the power of his Spirit, the beames of his mercie, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule, and ſheds in the freeneſſe of his grace into the heart, and that makes the ſoule flow againe, ſo that as it ebbed and went away from God by ſinne, ſo it now flowes and comes to God againe; but it is by the power and Spirit of God.</p>

This is the meaning of that place, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Bee it unto you according to your faith;</hi> not according to your wit, or pride, or ſtrength, or ſturdy ſpirits; as if a man would goe to Heaven, and bee proud and ſtout hearted too: no, no, there is no ſuch matter, not according to your parts and gifts, but according to your faith; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.

                  <hi>I will be a God to thee, and thy ſeed after thee;</hi> take all <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſo that beleeving ſets Gods grace a going, and puts Gods power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forth for the good of the ſoule. Now imagine the Lord did yet deny that ſoule that mercy which it ſeekes and begs, and doth not anſwer the deſire of the heart, and let in that good and ſweetneſſe the beleeving ſoule expects from him; what will faith doe then?</p>
               <p>This is the third Act of faith in drawing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from Chriſt, faith urgeth God with his owne word, and preſſeth Gods promiſe, and challengeth God on his faithfulneſſe and truth, not to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him, for the acceptation of his perſon, and the pardon of his ſinnes.

So faith when the Lord frownes upon him, yet the heart puts him in ſuit, as it were, and doth expoſtulate the cauſe with the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Hath the Lord forgotten to be gracious, and will he be no more intreated?</hi> This expoſtulation of the ſoule that the heart preſſeth in upon God withall, when it is upon a good ground, it argues the purſuit of God, that he will not leave till the Lord give that hee hath engaged himſelfe to beſtow. Thus to gather up all, faith goes out to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and layes hold upon him, layes all the weight upon him, drawes vertue from him, as in all the former particulars.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt thing wherein the great worke of reſting conſiſts is this; faith leaves the ſoule with the promiſe, and after all deſires (haply) and all denials, and all the diſcouragements of God; and yet the ſoule ſeeth not the way of God; but that God frownes upon him; and though God comes not, yet faith leaves the heart with God. This is marvellous needfull, and it muſt needs be the worke of faith; for it is the maine tenour of the worke of the covenant of grace, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes, in the covenant of workes made with <hi>Adam,</hi> when he ſaid, doe and live: If <hi>Adam</hi> had done that, hee ſhould have received conſtant aſſiſtance, and God would never have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to helpe him: but now in the covenant of grace, becauſe it muſt bee, and is free, and that a
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:4394:160"/> ſoule may and muſt know that it is onely the goodneſſe of God to us; therefore the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves this prerogative royall to himſelfe, that howſoever God will beſtow what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet hee reſerves the time to himſelfe, and what time he will doe it, and after what manner, and by what means, that is onely of Gods free will: and hereupon the ſoule acknowledgeth that it is of Gods free grace; as if the Lord ſhould ſay, it is mercy that I give, and therefore it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my owne minde, and I will take my owne time.</p>
               <p>Now in this dead lift the power of faith is this; it leaves the ſoule with the promiſe, it takes up its ſtanding there, and ſaith, I will goe to none other, and I will ſeeke no further, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.16. <hi>He that beleeves, makes not haſte,</hi> hee makes haſte to uſe the means, but he is content to ſtay till the Lord pleaſe, becauſe he knowes the Lord onely muſt doe it: and if the heart bee given to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine, ſaying, I pray, and the Lord doth not anſwer; I have grapled with my ſinne, and the Lord ſubdues it not: now faith ſaith, we muſt goe to God for mercy, that hee may order all our occaſions; and wee muſt not order Gods grace according to our humours: but the Lord ſeemes to frowne upon the ſoule, and to reject the prayers of a poore ſinner, and to beat him away from the doore, as the Lord Chriſt did, when hee called the woman a dog; yet faith will bring on the heart ſtill, and it will be ſure to lye at the gate, and it keepes the ſoule with the promiſe, what
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:4394:161"/> ever befals it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Mine eyes failed for loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up for thy word, Oh when wilt thou comfort me!</hi> his heart and all failed him, and yet he would looke towards heaven. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when will this ſinfull ſoule be humbled, and this diſtreſſed conſcience pacified?</hi> hee would looke towards heaven till hee had no heart; and therefore excellent is that paſſage, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 32.36. when the Lord and <hi>Iacob</hi> were wreſtling, and the Lord would have beene gone, <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee goe, untill thou haſt bleſſed mee:</hi> ſo the faithfull ſoule layes hold upon the Lord for mercy, pardon, power, and grace, and though the Lord ſeeme to give him up to the torment of ſinne and corruption; yet the ſoule ſaith, though my ſoule goe downe to hell, yet I will hold here for mercy, till the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and pardon, and ſubdue graciouſly theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed corruptions, which I am not able to maſter my ſelfe. As it is with a ſun-diall, the nature of the direction is this, the needle is ever moving, and a man may jog it another way, yet it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtand ſtill, till it come to the north-point: ſo when the Lord leaves off a beleeving heart with frownes, and with the expreſſion of diſpleaſure, yet the ſoule turnes to the Lord Chriſt, and will never leave, till it goe God-ward, and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and grace-ward; and ſaith, let the Lord doe what he pleaſe, I will goe no further, till hee bee pleaſed to ſhew mercy: then the iſſue is this, faith goes out to Chriſt, it layes hold upon Chriſt, and layes the weight of all upon Chriſt, and drawes vertue from Chriſt, and it leaves the ſoule
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:4394:161"/> with the promiſe, and this is in every faithfull ſoule under heaven, howſoever the ſenſe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: if the ſoule once come to Chriſt, it will never away, but ever cleaves to the promiſe, and is towards God and Chriſt, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall it.</p>

Now no man can yeeld obedience to Gods commandement, and thereby pleaſe God, except he goe to God by faith, and receive power from God, thereby to pleaſe God: I take this to be a truth, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of language and ſpeech, faith (as wee now ſpeake of it) is not any part of the ſpirituall life and ſoule of a Chriſtian, but a ſpirituall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and engine, whereby the ſoule goes to God
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:4394:164"/> to fetch a ſoule, whereby he may live: thus it is punctually, the ſoule in vocation goes to God, and being come, it receives the ſpirit of adoption, brings in the image of ſanctification, which <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt: and now the ſinner is inabled to live in obedience unto God; ſo that in vocation we goe to God, and in adoption we receive the ſpirit, the image of ſanctification from God, and by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification the ſpirit brings new ſpirituall powers from God to the ſoule: and ſo the ſoule is inabled to love God above all, and his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: now whether <hi>Adam</hi> had this faith or no, I will not ſtand to diſpute in this popular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but onely ſpeake ſo much as ſhall be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and profitable. Therefore for the thing in hand, this I take to be the excellency of faith, to goe out to God to fetch a ſpirituall new principle of life and grace: faith ſaith, thou art dead, and muſt have life, and thy life is to be had only from God; and therefore goe out, that thou maiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſpirituall life from God: ſo then, when no other can bring it ſelfe life, faith brings all other graces; now faith doth all theſe, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it goes to him that hath all life in him: faith is the field, and the pearle is in it, and the hid treaſure is in Chriſt; and faith goes to God from whom it received all things, from the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; this is the meaning of that place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and to this it is to be referred, <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glorie of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie, even by the ſpirit of the Lord;</hi> this diſcovers

So <hi>Adam</hi> did not beleeve a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe the Lord Chriſt was not revealed, and adminiſtred to him; but <hi>Adam</hi> had that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

                  </gap>is that which doth directly croſſe the eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency; and the innocency of <hi>Adam</hi> wherein he was created, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by no means agree to him, and that appeares thus: for a man to have a principle of life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe which <hi>Adam</hi> had, and to fetch a principle of life from another, which wee doe by faith, theſe are contrary the one to the other, hee lives well, and to bee ſaved by living well, and to bee ſaved by another, and to live well by the power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe are contraries one to the other, to have all in himſelfe as <hi>Adam</hi> had, and to have all from another, and not in himſelfe; theſe are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions the one to the other, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together, and therefore obſerve it, the manner and phraſe of Scripture is this, and it is very ſtrange, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. That I may bee found in him, not having mine owne righteouſneſſe, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> in his eſtate of innocency was in himſelfe, and had his owne righteouſneſſe, he had a power to pleaſe God, and to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by it: but now in the time of the Lord Chriſt, the caſe is cleare, wee are not, nor cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then I reaſon thus, that which is croſſe to the innocencie of <hi>Adam,</hi> and contradicts the eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, that can never agree to the eſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> but for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to have all from him if it had beene revealed, this had beene croſſe to the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore it is not poſſible that he ſhould have this faith in him; now I come to anſwer ſome objections.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, now I come to ſhow how the Lord workes upon the heart, this is eaſie for all of you to apprehend, and you may the better ſee the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods worke, if yee obſerve theſe foure rules; the maine weight lies upon the third, and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:4394:175"/> the fourth; therefore we will onely propound the two former to make way for the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when God comes to worke upon a poore ſinner, hee findes him dead in ſinne, and hee hath no good at all in him, no ſaving ſupernaturall good, and hee is not able to worke any good in himſelfe by all the meanes in the world, and he is not able to receive any ſpirituall good in the uſe of thoſe meanes; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I know that in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing;</hi> and our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whatſoever is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh;</hi> whatſoever comes from man, from corrupted fleſh, is uncleane; ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnall or the fleſhly wiſdome is not ſubject to the law of God;</hi> ſo that a man not only hath no good in himſelfe, but he is not able to receive any good, but rather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, hence it is cleare, that all ſaving workes are the proper gifts of God, and the peculiar ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his good Spirit in the hearts of thoſe that have it, for if every man by nature is dead in ſinne, and hath no good of himſelfe, and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no good, but rather oppoſe it, then if hee have any ſaving worke wrought in him, it is Gods free gift: therefore firſt the Lord meets with a poore ſinner, and reveales himſelfe to him before he be aware of it, as many a man haply drops into the congregation, or fals into a houſe where there is conference, and mercy, and grace, ſhines upon him, before he is aware of it, and doth effectually draw the ſoule home from ſinne to God; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man comes to me, except the Father which

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, (and this I would have you marke) though all grace come from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the power of his Spirit, yet the Lord workes the worke of his grace and Spirit, after a divers manner: and the manner eſpecially, which is remarkable, is this; no man hath grace by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any good, and all that he hath is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of God, and this God workes, though differently; ſome workes God workes upon us, to bring us to himſelfe, and ſome workes God workes in us, to bring us into a nearer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That excellent thing which was committed to thee, keepe faſt,</hi> how? <hi>by the Spirit that dwels in us;</hi> this excellent thing was the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell; now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> perſwades us, to keepe it by the Spirit that dwels in us, this is a matter which blindes many a poore ignorant man, that otherwiſe would beſtow himſelfe upon the free grace of God; we truly ſay, that all grace comes from Chriſt, hereupon many a man thinkes that he muſt firſt be in Chriſt, before he can have any grace; we receive Chriſt by faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt have faith, before we can have him,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:4394:176"/> and wee come to Chriſt by faith, and therefore we muſt have faith before wee can come to him: now the Lord Jeſus is the Authour of all grace in the hearts of his owne; the Lord workes ſome grace upon us to bring us himſelfe, as the worke of preparation and vocation, this is a ſaving worke of Chriſt, but yet it is the worke of the Lord to bring us home to himſelfe, but now when we are come by faith, then God conveyes another worke to us, he doth juſtifie a ſinner, and adopt him, and ſanctifie him: as in this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by way of a naturall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt beget a childe, before he can imprint his image of corruption upon him, and he muſt be the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> before he can receive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that generation is the way to corruption, elſe it is no corruption, as in that place, <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſonne in his owne image, that is, as blinde, as ſtubborne, as proud as <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that generation is the way by which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive corruption from the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo it is in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he doth by ſpirituall regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after a ſpeciall manner worke upon the hearts of his, to bring them home to him, before he will imprint his image upon them, which is the image of ſanctification; the Lord Jeſus will by the worke of vocation and preparation, as by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall union, bring the ſoule to himſelfe, before he will imprint his image upon him ſanctification; now preparation and vocation goe before ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and yet they are not ſanctification in the ſtrict ſenſe; as generation went before the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:4394:177"/> of the fathers image, ſo vocation to Chriſt, is before the image of Chriſt can bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed: I uſe to expreſſe my ſelfe by this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, looke as it is with a clocke that hath the wheeles turned the rong way, what muſt a man doe to make theſe wheeles goe right? Firſt he ſtops the wheeles, and the wheeles doe not ſtop themſelves, and then he turnes the wheele, and the wheele doth not turne it ſelfe, and when hee hath done ſo, then he gives it a poiſe or pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, and by vertue thereof the wheeles run right, and the clocke ſtrickes right, all theſe are ſeverall worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the wheele, the ſtopping is not the turning, and the turning is not the ſtriking: ſo it is with the ſoule of a poore ſinner, the heart of man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> like this wheele, it was made for God to pleaſe him, and to ſerve him, and was altogether heaven-ward, but now it is hell-ward, and ſin-ward, and world-ward, and it is quite unjoynted: now how muſt God worke upon this heart, to bring it into the right frame againe? Firſt, the Lord ſtop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the poore ſinner, and that is by preparation, he ſhewes him his ſinne, and the puniſhment of it, and when he is poſting on to hell, the Lord writes bitter things againſt him, and ſaith, friend this is not the way to happineſſe, friend if you goe that way, there is the pit of deſtruction before you, and ſo with a mighty ſtrong commanding hand he ſtops the ſinner by godly feare, and ſorrow, and hatred, and turnes it from wickedneſſe. Secondly, the Lord turnes the heart to himſelfe in vocation, and the Lord ſaith, come hither thou poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:4394:177"/> doe not goe to thy luſts, they will kill thee; but goe to the Lord Chriſt, and he will ſave thee; goe not to the world, it will delude thee; but goe to the Lord Chriſt, and he will inrich thee; thou art filthy, but goe to Chriſt, and he will purge thee; thou art miſerable, but come to Chriſt, here is happineſſe, and that will ſave thee: by thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time the wheele is ſtopped, and alſo turned the right way, and every wheele is where it ſhould be: and then the Lord juſtifies a poore ſinner, and is well pleaſed with him, and is reconciled to him, and he giveth his Spirit in adoption, and that is as the poiſe, that ſo he ſhall no more be ruled by the world, nor by his luſts, but by the good Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the hand of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth aſſiſt that poore ſoule for ever. Thirdly, the ſoule having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit by faith, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. receives here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the adoption of ſonnes. Fourthly, now the whole frame of the heart runs right, and is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and for God, and loves God, and hath the ſpirituall power, and a new principle of it ſelfe, and this is the maine worke of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if you will take ſanctification in the ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſenſe, all the reſt are ſaving workes, but this is the maine worke of all. Fiftly, as the clocke when it is thus framed, ſtrikes right, and when it is two, it ſtrikes two, and when it is three; it ſtrikes three: ſo the ſoule is thus led by the Spirit of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. and then it obeyes God, and doth every good duty, and loves God above all, and his neighbours as himſelfe, in truth, and in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:4394:178"/> uprightneſſe, ſo that the ſoule is ſtopped in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and is turned in vocation, it receives the poiſe in adoption, and renovation in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and it obeyes God in all things: then the concluſion is this, all theſe are ſaving workes, and ſuch as doe undoubtedly accompany ſalvation, but all this while, one is not another, for two of theſe are wrought upon us, that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and vocation, and theſe are by a paſſive worke: the wheele workes becauſe it is moved, and in the other three the Lord conveyes his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to us, and mercifully workes the power of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in us, and makes us able to ſerve him and obey him; <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to the Gentiles to open their eyes, to turne them from the power of darkneſſe to God, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheritance amongſt them that are called and ſanctified: marke all the paſſages of it, from darkneſſe and Sathan, that is, in preparation; to God and to light, that is, in vocation: and as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent, and be converted, that yee ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, that he may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, that is in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:4394:178"/> juſtification and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified, thats in ſanctification, &amp; all theſe are done by faith: the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt there, is to diſcover the frame of grace in the heart; and therefore it is not to be underſtood of the nature of Sanctification, but of the worke of it; that a man ſhould receive his ſanctification by faith, and yet is but ſanctified in part, theſe are contraries.</p>
               <p>The fourth is onely the worke of ſanctification, and laſtly from the queſtion thus reſolved; from hence that queſtion falls to the ground, and from hence, firſt a man may ſee it clearly that ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation comes after juſtification: and ſecondly, whether repentance is before faith, or whether repentance is before juſtification, or juſtification before faith and repentance: and thirdly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any other inſtrument to beleeve in Chriſt, but faith; No, there is no other, for they all concurre by faith: Thus much for the firſt uſe; a word of confutation, and information.</p>

It is the miſery that befalls poore creatures, they are loth to be knowne to be drunkards, or theeves, or

What is the eſtate of the damned in Hell? and this ſhall bee the ſentence that is paſt againſt the wicked in that day, when the Heavens ſhall melt, and the Goats ſhall ſtand on the left hand, and the Sheep on the right hand, and when ye ſhall ſee all the Heavens on a flame, and you ſhall heare that fearfull voyce, ſaying; ariſe you damned unbeleeving wretches, ſtand forth and heare your doome; what will bee your greateſt miſery in that day? even this, <hi>Depart from me yee

Oh ſtrive mightily with God, and with your owne ſoules, and reſt not till you get ſome ſtrength from Heaven, and ſay if that voice ſhould come againe, Oh, woe to mee for ever, well my unbeleeving heart doth this, and hath paſt the ſentence upon mine owne ſoule; you heare theſe, and if you would but take home theſe truths, they would make you ſtagger: See what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40. <hi>You will not come to mee that yee may have life: but I know you that yee have not the love of God in you:</hi> comming is beleeving, is this

Infidelity ſhuts up a poore

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:4394:185"/> but there is nothing that can kill corruption, but onely the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the power of his grace; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus hath freed mee from the law of ſinne, and of death;</hi> ſinne ſets up a law, and rules in the heart, as you ſhall finde it in your owne hearts; pride ſaith, you ſhall bee proud, there is a ſoveraigne rule, and a tyranicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which pride expreſſeth in the heart; now the Spirit of the Lord Ieſus, ſets up another law, and there is more commanding power in that, than in the corruption of the ſoule; and the law of the Spirit taketh away the power of ſinne, that would prevaile againſt a poore ſinner; the law of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt, takes away the law of anger in the heart; and the law of patience in Chriſt, takes away the law of impatience; and the law of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, takes away the law of cowardize; and the law of chaſtity, takes a way the power of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo that there is no ſinne can be ſubdued, but by the power of Chriſt, and the work of his Spirit: now unbeleefe keepes the heart wholly from Chriſt, therefore it can receive no good from Chriſt, and from hence it is that all ſinne is maintained in the ſoule in the full vigour of it, there is no unbeleever in all the world, but he hath all ſinne ſtrongly in him, and not one ſinne that ever was ſlaine; it is ſtrange to ſee, when unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe previles but a little in the heart of a poore Saint, how all other ſinnes put out their heads, and ſhew themſelves a maine; as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired to ſift thee, as wheat, but I

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:4394:186"/> and the powerfull worke thereof, may marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſnub and wound ſinne; but infidelitie will heale it againe, and will reſtore life to it againe. I compare reformation to the retreat of an army, when one ſide is weake, and the other ſide is too ſtrong, and they are not able to make their parts good, then they make a retreat, and goe home againe to their trenches, and hee that wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats himſelfe, though he may loſe the day, yet he loſeth not a man, and the Commander ſaith, ſuch a man was wounded, and ſuch a man was hurt a little, but we came all well home; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat into the trenches, and get more ſtrength, and then they levy our their forces againe. So it is with outward reformation, haply a man lives under a powerfull Miniſter, under a good maſter, and in a good family, and all theſe make ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; and hee dares not ſweare, and he cannot walke in his wicked wayes, his maſter curbs him, all this while his ſinnes make a retreat; but there is none of them gone, the life of never a one of them is gone, ſo long as he hath an unbeleeving heart: let the unbeleever enjoy never ſuch means, and live in never ſo good a family, yet he hath not one ſinne killed, they are onely retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo unbeleefe nurſeth them, and makes them grow out with greater violence. This I take to be the reaſon why many a man that hath profeſſed the Goſpell, and hath had much horror of heart, and many good reſolutions, and much care expreſſed outwardly after many yeers, his corruptions breake out againe and get ground,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:4394:187"/> and they are armed afreſh, and they run violently, and for any thing a man knowes, they goe downe to hell: how many profeſſours have turned to be uncleane perſons, and to be drunkards, becauſe their old ſinnes were but onely ſnubbed by good company and the word, &amp;c. But they never had their hearts throughly broken; the root that nurſed all, was ſtill the ſame, and therefore they breake out notoriouſly, to the diſhonour of God, the ſcandall of the Goſpell, and the confuſion of their owne ſoules, if God be not mercifull.</p>

A man would not imagine it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but that experience hath made it good, and others have informed us of it, that many wiſe judicious men are not aſhamed to ſpeake it, that if people knew the current of the Scriptures, and were able to underſtand the texts of Scripture, it were not ſo hard a matter to beleeve as men would make it; but men are not able to dive into the nature of Scriptures, and to conceive of the myſteries thereof, which if they did, it were an eaſie matter to beleeve; this is the conceit of a company of poore deluded creatures, though otherwiſe learned and judicious; follow theſe men home, and you ſhall finde this true, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are careleſſe in their families, or elſe they have ſome tang of ſome ſtrong corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: now to overthrow theſe two, let mee doe it upon theſe two grounds; Firſt, ſee the difficulty of the worke of faith, in regard of the feebleneſſe of all that a man hath or doth to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: Secondly, in regard of the extraordinary greatneſſe of the worke, that may hinder a man from doing what he may; for the firſt, that which may diſ-inable all thoſe things that a man expects comfort from; there are but foure things that a man can put any confidence in; firſt, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his parts; or, ſecondly, the height of his privileges; or, thirdly, the performance of his duties; or, fourthly, the powerfulneſſe of thoſe meanes that he hath: to ſumme up theſe briefly, and to overthrow them; firſt, hadſt thou that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:4394:192"/> ſtrength of judgement, ſharpneſſe of wit, and quickneſſe of memorie, and all naturall abilities, none of all theſe can make thee able to worke faith in thy ſelfe; <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. when Chriſt had conſidered the hardneſſe and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worke of faith, and had upbraided the Phariſees becauſe they beleeved not, at laſt hee ſaith, <hi>I thanke thee heavenly Father, Lord, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the great and wiſe of the world, and haſt revealed them unto the babes; it is ſo, Oh Father, becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> if wiſedome, and prudence, and skill in arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, would have carried men to Jeſus Chriſt, the Scribes and Phariſees would then have gone to him; but God hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent; ſo it will be in every man, bee his parts and abilities never ſo great, for the worke of faith, it is not in thy parts and gifts, but in the Lords revealing, it is not thy ſelfe, but the Lord that muſt worke it; babes themſelves ſhall have theſe things revealed, and ſhall be made able to beleeve, when thou with all thy parts, and gifts, and wiſdome, ſhalt be caſhiered, and thrown downe to hell; and then he ſhewes the reaſon of it, <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, and he to whom the Sonne will reveale him;</hi> ſo then, it is not what we have or doe, but what the Lord Chriſt can and will doe for us; all the wit in thy head, and all thy skill and parts, will never make thee able to know the Father, unleſſe the Lord Chriſt will make thee able to know him; if Chriſt make thee

               <p>Thirdly, all thy duties, though they were never ſo glorious in the eye of another, and never ſo great in thine owne apprehenſion, yet they are all too weake to worke this grace of faith in thy ſoule: <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Laſtly, the power of means are not able to frame the ſoule to this bleſſed gift of beleeving: a man would thinke that if a mans paines were great, and the means powerfull, that this would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke faith, but yet this will not doe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for then Ieruſalem that had all the Prophets to foretell a Chriſt, and all the proclamations of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt himſelfe preaching, that ſpake as never man did, and beſides all theſe, ſhee had miracles expreſſing the power of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that doctrine, yet ſhe fals ſhort of the work; as, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.37. <hi>Though they ſaw many miracles, yet they beleeved not in Chriſt:</hi> they had all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, and all the ſacrifices and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and thither the Tribes went up, and all the helpe that ever any had, and yet they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not: and therefore it is that Chriſt upbraids them heavily for their fearfull ſcandalous hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.16. He compareth them <hi>to little children ſitting in the market place, and calling unto their fellowes, ſaying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; wee have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented:</hi> that is, no means in the world would worke upon them: <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> came in the way of humiliation, and Chriſt came in the way of comfort, but all would not prevaile with their hearts, no Law, nor Goſpell.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, it is very profitable and uſefull, as the Apoſtle ſaith, becauſe though wee cannot worke faith in the uſe of the means, yet God by the uſe of the means can doe what he will: the begger muſt come to the doore, though the man in his love and bounty provides to give the doale, yet the begger muſt come to the doore to wait till it be given him. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. The Apoſtle confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thoſe which had beleeved through grace: So that the Word of God, &amp; the meane of grace, and all the duties that we doe, theſe are but as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit pipes to convey what God is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; he may ſtay the Conduit when he will, hee may worke with means and without means, but let us wait upon God in the uſe of them. The Lord in them may and haply will work upon thee: So that if the beſt meanes, and the chiefeſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and the beſt duties cannot worke faith, then I preſume it is not onely difficult, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of parts, and privileges, and all duties and means of themſelves, it is impoſſible ever to have this faith wrought, and therefore it is not eaſie to get this faith into the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the weakneſſe of the means that ſhould doe this worke, ſhewes that it is difficult, ſo alſo the greatneſſe of the worke hinders us, that we are not able to compaſſe it by all the means we doe enjoy: Now the greatneſſe of the worke of faith will diſcover it ſelfe in three particulars: Firſt, becauſe there muſt be ſeverall hinderances
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:4394:195"/> removed, before there can be any room for faith; and theſe hinder the power of Satan, that takes poſſeſſion of the ſoule naturally, and the ſupreme ſoveraignty of ſin, it carries the whole man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the luſts thereof, and the ſoule muſt bee brought from under both theſe, before it can be brought to Jeſus Chriſt: the ſoule muſt be brought from under the juriſdiction of ſin, and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Satan, before it can be tranſlated unto the kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. the Apoſtle was ſent to the Gentiles <hi>to open their eyes, and to turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi> Every man by nature is in darknes, and under the power of ſin, now the Apoſtle muſt turne them from the power of ſin, before he can bring them to God, and all this muſt be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can receive remiſſion of ſins, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the blood of Chriſt. Now darknes, and ſinne, and Satan, expreſſe their dominion over the ſoule, and wee cannot have ſinne and Satan to bee our Lord, and have Chriſt our Lord too: This muſt be wrought in preparation: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29. <hi>The ſtrong man muſt bee bound, and caſt out before another ſtrong man can come to take poſſeſſion:</hi> Satan is the ſtrong man, who by the power of ſinne takes poſſeſſion of the ſoule: now the power of ſinne and Satan muſt bee eaſt out by the power of preparation and humiliation. Now for a man to plucke a poore ſoule from the power of ſinne and Satan, and to wreſt the keyes from the hand of the devill; and to reſcue a poore ſoule from the malice of the devill, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:4394:195"/> and combination betweene ſinne and the ſoule, and to withdraw the heart from theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and from that power which ſinne and Satan and Gods juſtice would expreſſe in the ſoule, no man can doe it, but onely hee that hath a greater power than both theſe, which none but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.18. <hi>which hath the keyes of hell and of death:</hi> now the key is a ſigne of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt only hath the key of hell &amp; death: tis he that hath led captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: tis he that triumphed over all his enemies: therefore he only can pull the ſoule from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſin and Satan, and ſo prepare a way for faith, and thereby bring the ſoule to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the glorious nature and the excellencies of this grace of faith, looke upon the ſurpaſſing excellency of the worke of faith above all other graces; for we have made it good by argument heretofore, that faith is a worke above man in his corrupt eſtate: ſo that a man may truly ſay, that this worke of faith is more than naturall: now for nature to worke above nature, tis above common ſenſe: that a tree ſhould ſee and walke, and a beaſt to reaſon, theſe things nature abhorres. Now becauſe faith is above corrupted nature, therefore it is impoſſible for man to worke it in himſelfe: this I take to be the reaſon why this gracious worke of God findes more contradiction in the heart, than any grace I know. A man findes a greater doe with his owne heart, and a greater hardneſſe and croſneſſe in the heart to come in and beleeve, than to doe any
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:4394:196"/> thing elſe; a man will heare, and read, and pray, and doe any thing, and mourne, but to beleeve it is that which a man ſcarce conſiders of; and this is the reaſon of it, becauſe not onely corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oppoſes the worke of faith, but even a mans gifts, and ſelfe, and ſufficiency which God gives him, that now and then ſeemes to bee the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, its through our corruptions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: in other things it is not ſo; we would faine get ſorrow, and therefore we labour for it; and we would have love, and therefore we labour for it; But all this is out of our owne power or abilities; we would keepe us in our ſelves, but faith would have us goe out to Chriſt: and our parts would worke this in us; but faith ſayes wee muſt goe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe wee are not able to doe that which he commands.</p>
               <p>So now you ſee that a mans parts and abilities are ſometimes great hinderances and barres to keep a man from beleeving; and this is the reaſon why, if God opens a mans eyes, and diſcovers a mans corruptions, by nature we fall to doing, to repenting formally, and all this while never ſee a need of a Chriſt, but reſt in our ſelves and our owne abilities, and will never goe to Chriſt: Thouſands goe to hell this way; the moſt that profeſſe the Goſpell, and periſh, they periſh upon this point. So then the work is more than naturall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if wee conſider the manner of Gods working upon the ſoule in beleeving, the Lord doth not concurre in an ordinary common kinde of providence; as meeting with ſome power and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:4394:196"/> abilitie in the ſoule to helpe forward the worke, as God moves, and wee move, and wee are co-workers with God in ſeverall paſſages; and ſo it is in all the workes of ſanctification which comes after faith. There is ſtill ſomething that concurs with God in the worke, but now it is a true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, hee findes nothing in the ſoule, but meere feares and oppoſitions at firſt; and therefore Divines doe truly ſay, that it is more to make the ſoule beleeve, than to create a world, for in the creating of the world, the Lord had no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he onely ſpake the word, and all was made; but now ſinne and Satan, and the world and all, ſet againſt the poore ſoule. If a man gets a knocke by the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be humbled, then carnall friends begin to perſwade, and every man hath a blow to hinder him from receiving the powerfull impreſſion of the Word of God; ſo that the Lord in this worke findes more fierce oppoſitions, than in any worke; and moreover, when theſe oppoſitions are oppoſed and removed, and the Lord comes into the ſoule, the ſoule is very emptie, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive nor cloſe with any grace. As it is with a dead man, hee hath no power to quicken himſelfe, as. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 19.20. <hi>What is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power to us ward, who beleeve accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the working of his mighty power which hee wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead:</hi> the ſame Almighty power which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, the ſame power the Lord puts forth in bringing a dead ſoule to beleeve:
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:4394:197"/> So that as the dead body hath no living vertue in it ſelfe to quicken it ſelfe, ſo the ſoule hath no ability to beleeve of its owne ſelfe: but ſee how the Apoſtle cannot content himſelfe to ſpeake of this worke of God, you ſhall ſee five degrees in it, what is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power to us that beleeve. Firſt, the power of God: Secondly, the greatneſſe of it: Thirdly, the exceſſiveneſſe of this greatneſſe: Fourthly, the exceſſiveneſſe of that mightineſſe: Fifthly, the working of all together: ſo that there is the exceeding greatneſſe, and the exceſſive great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the mightineſſe of that exceſſiveneſſe, and then the worke of all: as if he had ſaid, view you the heavens, ſearch all the ſtories, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the miracles that ever God wrought, and there is none equall to his, to bee compared with this worke of beleeving. I ſay of faith as <hi>Iacob</hi> did of <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 49.3. <hi>Reuben thou art my firſt borne, my might, and the beginning of my ſtrength, the excellency of dignities, &amp;c.</hi> So I ſay of faith, it is the firſt borne of all other graces, it is the might of God, and the beginning, and the excellency of the might and power of God: for as the firſt borne hath a double portion appointed by God, ſo this is the firſt borne, and hath a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Almighty Spirit of his.</p>
               <p>So then if it be ſo, that all the parts that ever a man had, and all the higheſt privileges, and meanes, and duties, cannot reach this worke, and are not able to worke faith, but are too feeble to worke faith: and if it bee ſo, that this worke is
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:4394:197"/> extraordinary great, and ſo are the hindrances to be removed, and none but Chriſt can doe it; and if faith bee ſupernaturall, the oppoſition againſt this worke of God bee ſo fierce, let then every man that heares the word of God this day, yeeld that it is unconceivable how it is done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more out of our power to worke it in our owne ſoules: therefore you that have heard, and underſtand the minde of God, that out of ignorance have beene deceived, to you I now ſpeake, you are to be intreated in the name of the Lord, to goe home, and ſay, and take ſhame to your ſelves, and confeſſe your owne folly; thou that haſt made it a eaſie worke to beleeve, ſaying, if people were but judicious to underſtand the Scriptures, it were eaſie to beleeve; now take ſhame to your ſelves, and ſay thus, Lord, the truth is, I condemned ſuch and ſuch a poore ſoule, I heard ſuch a man a mourning, and ſaying, hee could not beleeve; in the meane time I thought it was eaſie, or elſe they wanted wit; but I thought that by my parts and abilities, and becauſe I was able to ſee the depth of Scriptures, that therefore I could beleeve, and that it was an eaſie matter to doe it: but poore deluded creature that I was, I ſee now that I am no more able to beleeve out of my owne power, than to pull the ſunne from the heavens: conſider it ſadly, and know, that he that beleeves, muſt beleeve through grace, therefore parly with the promiſe, and ſay, Lord, I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve through grace: it is not parts nor privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, meanes nor duties, I muſt beleeve through

Secondly, it gives full content to the heart of a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; theſe follow from the former truth in this manner; if this be the nature of faith, to cauſe the ſoule to reſt upon the free grace of God in Chriſt, and to furniſh the ſoule with a ſupply of ſpirituall wants from hence, then this muſt needs make the life of a Chriſtian moſt eaſie; if faith makes the life of a Chriſtian ſo eaſie, then the ſoule muſt needs bee contented: but the nature of faith is this, to cauſe the ſoule to reſt upon God and his promiſe, and therefore it makes the life eaſie. Secondly, it furniſheth the ſoule with all neceſſaries, and therefore it gives the ſoule full content. Firſt of the former, the life of the beleever, is the life that hath moſt eaſe with
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:4394:200"/> it, and brings moſt delight with it; there is no life under heaven more free from tediouſneſſe, and hath more eaſe and liberty than a Chriſtian courſe; let a mans condition bee what it will bee, faith makes a mans life moſt eaſie: I uſe to compare the conditions of them that want faith, to the cart that is from his wheeles; they draw heavily, and they are in great extremitie, and they tug and toile, but it will not be drawne with any eaſe or good ſucceſſe: ſo unfaithfull ſoules ſinck in their ſorrowes upon every occaſion, and their lives are tedious and weariſome; but faith ſets the cart upon the wheeles, and carries all away eaſily and comfortably: you muſt know thus much, it is the hardeſt matter in the world to get faith, when we want it; but it is the moſt eaſieſt life in all the world, and hath the moſt delight in all the world, if wee have but skill to uſe it wiſely when we have it, and it gives moſt eaſe and quiet to a man in all his converſation: and this faith doth two wayes; Firſt, becauſe faith hath a skill, and a kinde of ſlight, to put over all cares to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that whereas the unfaithfull heart beares all the cares in himſelfe, and ſo he ſinckes under them; this is the cunning of faith, to put over all to another: wee take up the croſſe, but faith hurls all the care on Chriſt, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and you ſhall finde reſt to your ſoules;</hi> faith makes a man reſt, and goe on eaſily in a Chriſtian courſe, and all his troubles are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore he may goe on eaſily in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe; all his troubles are removed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:4394:201"/> he may goe on with eaſe; whereas the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull heart is as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Like a wave of the ſea, toſſed to and fro:</hi> and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.20. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, but they are as a raging ſea, which cannot reſt;</hi> faith ſets us to the worke, but it layes all the weight of the worke upon another; it is an eaſie matter to lye under the burthen, when another beares all the weight of it: this is the difference betweene a faithfull ſoule, and a man that lives by his wits and ſhifts; looke as it is with two ferry men, the one of them hals his boat about the ſhoare, and cannot get off, but tugs and puls, and never puts her forth to the tide; but the other puts his boat upon the ſtreame, and ſets up his ſaile, and then hee may ſit ſtill in his boat, the winde will carry him whither he is to goe: Juſt thus it is with a faithfull ſoule, and an unbeleever; all the care of the faithfull ſoule is to put himſelfe upon the ſtreame of Gods providence, and to ſet up the ſaile of faith, and to take the gale of Gods mercie and providence, and ſo he goes on cheerfully, becauſe it is not he that carries him, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; whereas every unfaithfull ſoule tugs and puls at the buſineſſe, like the ferryman with his boat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhoare, and can finde neither eaſe, nor cheare, nor ſucceſſe, becauſe hee thinkes by his owne wits and power to doe what he would; but faith will keepe a man upon the ſtreame of Gods providence, and labours for the bleſſing of God to carrie him along, and ſo he reſts himſelfe upon the free grace of God: this makes the life of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:4394:201"/> faith marvellous eaſie and free from trouble, and makes the ſoule goe on wonderfull cheerfully: though the childe were naked, yet if the father would buy cloth, and ſee the garment fitted for him, hee only to take it and put it on; were not this eaſie? and though the childe were even hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſtarved, yet if the father would provide meat and drinke, and ſet it before him, hee only to eat it; were not this eaſie? when the Lord had made a marriage for his Sonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. the text ſaith, <hi>He hath killed his fatlings, and drawne out his wines, all things are ready, come therefore to the marriage;</hi> this is all that God lookes for at our hands, all the dainties of life and ſalvation, peace, pardon, power againſt corruption, whatſoever we can want, they are all prepared, onely come unto the marriage: take this mercie, and feed upon theſe precious comforts that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt offereth unto us: if you want grace, and if you want wiſdome, and power, and holineſſe, and patience, you may goe to Jeſus Chriſt, and take it, it is bought and paid for already, onely take it and put it on; is not this an eaſie life? what would you have, brethren? nay, yet more, if more may be added, all that the Lord requires in this caſe, is, in a manner, to ſtand ſtill, and ſee what the Lord will doe for him; as in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.15. to the 20. when <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> was in a great ſtraight, and knew not what to doe, the Lord ſaith to him, <hi>The battle is not yours, but Gods, ſtand ye ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God;</hi> it is eaſie conquering, when a man may ſtand ſtill, and overcome by looking on
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:4394:202"/> the adverſaries; then in the 19. verſe, the Levites the Sonnes of the Kohathites, fell to ſinging and to praiſing of God, when as yet they had not ſtrucke one ſtroke in the battle; but the truth is, they had the victorie by faith, they beleeved the Prophets of God, the Prophets had ſpoken it, and therefore the King did beleeve it, that it ſhould be done; and it was not only ſo in that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſe of his, wherein the power and life of faith was expreſſed, but it is that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to all the Saints of God in their ſpirituall combats, and what God did for the King in that caſe, the ſame hee doth for all the Saints; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>The beleevers are more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;</hi> and why ſo? there is no man can conquer before hee come into the field, and contend with his enemies; but wee overcome before wee fight, how? through him that loved us: if wee looke upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and keepe our hearts by a holy bent to the promiſes of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall overcome our enemies; this is the firſt ground.</p>

               <p>Now faith workes a mans full content three wayes:</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it inables a man to all duties; and more than theſe cannot be added nor deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, faith ſupplies all wants, faith plucks the ſoule, and hales the heart of a poore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an away from all thoſe ſecret boſome diſtempers, as pride, and ſuch like, which breed any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment within a man, as all curioſitie, and all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:4394:203"/> pride and unquietneſſe, for theſe rack the ſoule with a reſtleſſe diſcontent, all the inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and the like: theſe luſts and corruptions ought not to bee quieted, nay it cannot bee; for ſpirituall things will not ſatisfie a corrupt heart; and worldly things cannot quiet it: Now faith divorceth the ſoule, and withdrawes the heart from under the power of thoſe boyſterous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and makes the ſoule reſigne up it ſelfe to the good will of God, and when faith hath done theſe, then in the ſecond place faith makes the ſoule ſay, the good will of the Lord is better than any thing that hee ſhall deny, or than all the good things that an inordinate ſinfull heart can crave: faith makes the ſoule apprehend that whatſoever God doth, and whatſoever Gods pleaſure is, is better to him, than whatſoever hee can deſire, though God deny what he deſires: if God will have a man poore, faith ſayes, it is better than if he had given him riches; and if it bee the will of God to lay ſhame and diſgrace upon a man, faith ſayes, it is better that God lay ſhame upon me than honours, becauſe it is his good will and pleaſure ſo to have it, and ſo the heart is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted and fully contented, and the want is ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the will of God is better than to have what wee deſire. The Patient that truſts to the skill and faithfulneſſe of the Phyſitian, is better content to take pills from him, than all the beſt Cordials that can be deſired.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, faith either obtaines what wee need and deſire, or elſe procures a farre better thing
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:4394:204"/> than what we deſire; art thou in trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? faith will either fetch from God what thou needeſt, or elſe bring that which is better from the hands of God; by this means the Lord Chriſt cures all the diſcontentment that might creep in upon the hearts of his Diſciples: <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29. <hi>There is no man which ſhall loſe father, or mother, or wife, or children, or friends, for my Names ſake, but he ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit eternall life:</hi> whatſoever wee loſe for a Chriſt, we ſhall have a hundred fold recompence for it; as if a man for the cauſe of Chriſt ſuffer perſecution, or impriſonment, and loſeth peace here, thou thou ſhalt have peace with God, and thy ſoule ſhall proſper in grace; and if friends haply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee, and the father is againſt the ſonne, and the husband is ſet againſt the wife, thou ſhalt have the favour of the Lord God of heaven, which is better than the love of all earthly husbands or friends; for all theſe things here below are but as it were the ſhell, but this is the pith and ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, the love of God in Chriſt: and if a man loſe liberty for Chriſt, he ſhall have a thouſand times more libertie in the peace of a good conſcience, and a free heart to ſerve God: and in the 63. <hi>Pſalme</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Pſalme, David</hi> was in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> had baniſhed him from his houſe, and deprived him of friends and meanes, and all, yet ſee how <hi>David</hi> ſupplies all in the 3. verſe, <hi>becauſe thy loving kindneſſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life, my lips ſhall praiſe thee;</hi> and in the 5. verſe he ſaith, <hi>My ſoule ſhall bee filled as with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

In the 73. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 25. and the laſt verſe, compare them both together, and ſee how <hi>David</hi> makes the concluſion: <hi>David</hi> was almoſt diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, and his heart diſquieted with the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the wicked; therefore hee ſaid, if this bee ſo, <hi>then have I cleanſed my hands in innocencie, and waſhed my hands in vaine:</hi> yet marke how hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelfe againe, ſaying, <hi>Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and there is none in earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee; therefore it is good for me to draw neere to God.</hi> Let the wicked take the world, and their profits, and their pleaſures, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that I deſire in compariſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Conſider it ſadly, the wicked have much wealth, and friends, and means: Oh thou belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved faithfull ſoule, thou haſt the rich treaſury of grace and mercy to inrich thee, all this whole world is nothing to that rich treaſury of mercy which faith brings in: as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastes, Money anſwers all; if a man have money, he may buy meat to feed him, and cloth to apparell him, and cover him:</hi> If money will doe ſo much, what will mercy doe then? thou haſt not wealth, nor
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:4394:205"/> friends, nor meanes, but thou haſt mercy from God in Chriſt, and this will anſwer all: it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than friends, and meanes, and all: therefore if thou haſt this, let thy heart be contented, and know that thou haſt a childs part, and thy lot is fallen into a marvellous faire ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as faith takes off all miſeries, and ſupplies the want of them; ſo in the ſecond place faith takes away all feares for the time to come: alas, ſaith the ſoule, friends, and means, and wealth are good, but they continue not ever. What if ſickneſſe come? and if povertie come, what ſhall I doe then? and ſo the heart ſhakes at the feare of evill: Now pray marke how faith cures all feares, and takes off the edge of all thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that may bee brought upon a man, as in the 112. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 7. <hi>He ſhall not bee afraid of any evill tidings,</hi> why? <hi>for his heart is fixed, and he beleeveth in the Lord:</hi> for although heaven and earth may ſhake, yet God, and Chriſt, and the promiſe will never faile, and hee caſting his heart there by faith, he muſt needs hold. What is it that a man may feare? we feare the power, and policy, and malice of the devill and his wicked inſtruments; now faith outbids theſe, and faith reſts upon the precious promiſes of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and faith perſwades the heart that they have no power but from God, and they cannot uſe that power further than God gives leave, and they cannot have ſucceſſe further than God goes with them, they can goe no further than God gives a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Now, ſayes faith, that God which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:4394:205"/> the power of all theſe, he is my God, hee is the God of Hoſts; and none of all the armies can either command peace, neither can they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peace; therefore I adde a little more, faith levies new forces from heaven, againſt all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of earth; are the wicked politique? then ſayes faith, the Lord is much more wiſe, and is able to daſh all their enterpriſes: and are the wicked fierce, and violent? then faith lookes to God, where there is more power to defend him, than they can have to hurt him: doe wee ſee the wicked maliciouſly bent, and full of ſpleene to wrong the people of God? faith ſees mercy and goodneſſe in the Lord, that is more able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve us, than all the wicked can bee to hurt us: faith ſayes, if hell gates were open, and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills were about thy eares, they can doe nothing further than God gives them power, and gives a Commiſſion to them; therefore I may bee quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe God is more able to keepe me, than they are to hurt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, faith it is that inables a man to all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for imagine a man had all the power in his owne hands, and had no wants preſent, nor feared no wants nor troubles to come; if yet hee were not able to doe what God required, this would diſquiet his heart: therefore by faith the Lord inables a man to doe every duty that the Lord commends to him, or expects from him: It is the ground that <hi>Paul</hi> contents his heart withall, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can doe all things through the power of Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me:</hi> I can bee poore and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:4394:206"/> beare it, and I can be rich, and yet not ſurfet of the world; I can doe all, but how? through the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Chriſt inabling me: therefore famous is that of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18. God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a childe, and yet his body was dead, and his wife barren, and it was even againſt nature for him to beget a childe, or for her to beare any: Now how doth God provide for this? <hi>Abraham under hope, beleeved above hope;</hi> and in the 21. verſe becauſe he was <hi>fully perſwaded, that he that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, was able to make it good:</hi> there was no hope in nature, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould beget a child, his body being dead, and no hope that ſhe ſhould beare any; therefore faith goes to God that was able to quicken them: haſt thou a barren &amp; a dead heart as theirs was, and therefore thy ſoule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and thou ſaiſt, I ſhall never be able to goe through the worke required? I know it is the complaint of many poore ſoules; Oh ſend faith up to Heaven, and beleeve in him that is able to ſuccour you, and to quicken you, to whatſoever he requires; content thy heart in this manner, and ſay when thou findeſt thy heart dead, I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but the Lord is able to inlighten my blinde minde, and I have a dead barren heart, but the Lord who is the God of power, hee is able to quicken me, and to releeve a poore dead blockiſh ſinner. Hee beleeved in him (ſaith the Text) which calleth things that are not as if they were; <hi>Abraham</hi> is not lively, and <hi>Sarah</hi> is not fruitfull, but the Lord can make them ſo; and therefore faith goes to God; ſo thou ſhalt be wiſe, and have
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:4394:206"/> thy heart quickned to whatſoever duty concernes Gods prayſe and thy owne comfort; ſo then hee that hath what hee will, or can deſire, or ſtand in need of; and he that hath all his feares removed, and is inabled to doe all duties commanded: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can bee added to this man, therefore why ſhould not hee be contented? what would you have, you poore beleevers?</p>

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:4394:220"/> called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter, hee choſe them out of judgement, and accounted the reproaches of Chriſt greater honours, than to be ſo and ſo:</hi> He did not chuſe an honoured and an advanced Chriſt; and an enriched Chriſt; but he choſe afflictions, and the like; nay hee accounted them greater honours, than all the honours of Egypt: ſo wilt thou doe, if thy faith be ſound and right.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as thou wilt chuſe all Chriſt, and whatſoever comes with Chriſt; ſo there muſt bee nothing on thy part that muſt hinder the match, but thou muſt forſake it, and caſt it away, and let it rather be taken from thee, than thou to be takes from thy Saviour: As a man will not chuſe his luſts if he were an adulterer before, becauſe they will hinder him from receiving the chaſtity of a Saviour: Therefore he that will beſtow himſelfe upon a Saviour, he cannot but refuſe that adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe which would hinder him from matching with a Chriſt: and the ambitious man will not now chuſe his honours, but hee will caſt away his pride and ambition, and advancement, becauſe theſe will hinder him from receiving the humility of a Saviour. As a woman will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take her husband for better for worſe, ſo alſo ſhe muſt be content to caſt away whatſoever may hinder her from him, and ſhee will forſake friends or honours, or any thing that may hinder her from her beſt beloved; ſo if thou wilt chuſe Chriſt wholly, as thou muſt take a Chriſt, and all that comes with him, ſo thou muſt caſt away whatſoever may hinder thee from receiving him;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:4394:220"/> as <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Naomy, Ruth</hi> 1.16. <hi>Intreat mee nor to leave thee, or to returne from following thee; for where thou goeſt, I will goe; where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge; thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God ſhall be my God;</hi> ſo ſaith the ſoule: If luſt and pleaſure, or the world, or any darling delight come and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to ſet up thy ſelfe in ſtead of Chriſt; the ſoule ſaith, I have choſen a Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreat mee not to forſake the humility, and chaſtity, and meekneſſe of Chriſt: for I will live and die with him, hee ſhall bee my Saviour and Lord for ever. The Saints of God firſt gave away themſelves to God, and then to the Apoſtles; ſo faith chuſeth all a Chriſt, and beſtowes it ſelfe upon a Chriſt, to be ruled by him, and to enjoy whatſoever he hath, and to imbrace whatſoever comes with him, and to remove whatſoever may hinder the ſoule from him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Triall. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, juſtifying faith beares it ſelfe upon the promiſe in all its extremities, and is ſatisfied with it, for you know it is called reſting; as if hee had ſaid, here will I reſt for ever. Oh, this grace and mercy, I will goe no further, it is good to be here, to be ſo holy, and ſo glorious, and ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and juſtified: and ſo I confeſſe that pride and unbeleefe will have his ranges, and ſharke up and downe for ſome comfort and contentment in the world, and haply by baſe means: but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſaving faith is, when it feels theſe, it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, and breakes through them to come to the promiſe, and ſaith, now I ſee what you doe; reſt is not in the world, nor in profits, nor in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:4394:221"/> nor parts, nor abilities, nor any outward thing, but in the promiſe, and the promiſe is the portion of the ſoule, and that by which it lives, and the ſtock of commoditie which the ſoule trades withall; as a mans trades and his lands are his livings; though haply a friend may give him ſomething elſe ſometimes, yet hee lives by his owne means. So the faithfull ſoule will take what God gives, but it lives by the promiſe, and by the loving kindneſſe of the Lord, that is the maine life and maintenance of the ſoule: as it is with a woman now married to a man; you would account it a ſtrange thing if ſhee ſhould goe away to another womans husband to aske for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, this is an adulterous wretch, but the wife goes to her husband, and if there be any proviſion to be made, ſhee goes to her husband to provide it; and if any debts be to bee paid, her husband muſt pay them, and hee muſt pay all, and doe all, ſhe relies her ſelfe upon her husband: So when the heart pretends great matters that it loves Chriſt, and yet will have his backdoores, and hee muſt live by his wits and his ſhifts, this is an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous heart: It is rather of a harlot to his luſts, than of a holy chaſte man, that is eſpouſed to Chriſt: ſo it is with a faithfull ſoule; if he hath any wants, Chriſt ſhall heare of him; and if any trouble or diſtreſſe, faith ſends to her husband, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in heaven, and layes all the weight upon him; if any ſuccour comes in by the way, the ſoule takes it thankfully from God; and in the meane time he lives by the promiſe: as in

I doe not deny but that there are pranks and fetches of fleſh, and fleſh will have his bouts, yet take away all from a Chriſtian, and his heart is ſatisfied with Chriſt; and he goes to, and reſts upon, and is ſatisfied in a Chriſt; but if thou beare up thy heart with other buſineſſes, reſting upon thy gifts, and parts, and pompe, and place, then thy faith is naught, it reſts not upon Gods free grace, but upon it ſelfe, and upon ſome broken reed which will faile thee. When a man hath the world, and honours, and pleaſures to ſtand by him, he goes on cheerfully and comfortably, but when theſe are gone, all his comfort is gone, then thy faith is naught; for if thou hadſt reſted upon the free grace of Chriſt, thou wouldſt have been

The concluſion is this, the ſoule muſt bee perſwaded by the ſpirit of the Father: therefore nothing is the author of faith, but the Lord. Faith muſt come from Heaven, and from the Spirit of God, in the Word, if ever thou have that faith which will doe thee good.

It is a fooliſh deluſion of many, who thinke that onkly Sithians, and Parthians, and Turkes, and Pagans, want faith; this is an idle dreame, and a doating conceit, and prevailes too much even with thoſe that thinke themſelves ſome body, and are in high place: Oh, let not this deluſion prevaile with your judgements, for the former Doctrine comes as a ſwift witneſſe againſt ſuch as
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:4394:222"/> looke high, and profeſſe gloriouſly, and thinke their penny good ſilver; yet the former truth I ſay, is that which teſtifies to their faces, and to their conſciences, that there was never one dramme of ſaving faith wrought in them: Woe therefore to their ſoules for it, and to all ſuch, whoſe conditions ſhall bee found to bee ſo; yet this is not the greateſt of their miſery, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouhh they are in this condition, yet they will not ſee it, nor bee perſwaded of it, when their owne lives can teſtifie to their faces, and alſo proclaime to all the world, that there is no faith in their hearts, and Gods people mourne for them, and cry to God for them, and ſinke under the burthen of their miſerie; yet it is ſtrange to ſee how people will beare up themſelves with a blinde boldneſſe, and a wretched carnall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and conceits that they have faith: It is true ſay they, our lives are not ſo holy as they ought, and our workes are not ſo good as they ſhould be; therefore we truſt not to our workes, but to Jeſus Chriſt; he came to ſave ſinners, and we truſt in him: and all the worid, nay all the devills in hell ſhall not perſwade us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but we will beleeve in our Saviour. If we ſhould goe from man to man, and from houſe to houſe, and call at every mans doore and ſay, are there any beleevers here, they are at daggers drawing preſently, and ſay, are not we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers? and we hope to goe to heaven, as ſone as the proudeſt profeſſor of them all: many ſoules periſh this way, and goe downe to hell hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt,

               <p>I hope you will confeſſe this, that to beleeve is more than to ſay ſo, or to thinke ſo, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in a mans minde: nay it will coſt you much labour before that day come, that thoſe proud hearts of yours be humbled, and thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered ſoules of yours that are faſtned to your luſts and corruptions, be brought to beleeve, and to bee effectually perſwaded by the Spirit of the Father, and that thoſe doubting and ſtaggering ſoules of yours be brought to reſt upon free grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Oh, how few finde this worke, I can ſcarcely tell whether to make it a matter of lamentation, or of reproofe of thoſe that thinke they have faith, and have it not: I am afraid that too many of you will finde the want of it, when it is too late: If ever Doctrine were needfull to be preſſed, then now eſpecially in theſe times; that ſo if it were poſſible me might ſhake the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence of moſt men: Suffer mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to goe on plainly in this uſe of reproofe, and let me doe it in two particulars.</p>

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:4394:224"/> and people of the Jewes did not receive him; indeed ſome few did receive him, but the whole maſſe of the Jewes did refuſe him, nay they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it themſelves, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.48. when the rulers had ſent to take Chriſt, and in ſtead of bringing him, they returne wondring at him, and ſaid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake as this man doth, but ſaid they, doe any of the rulers, and of the Scribes, and the Phariſees beleeve in him; it was then the faſhion not to beleeve in Chriſt, it was the common road, and the common caſe; nay the ſinne and curſe that lyes upon the Jewes, proclaimes it at this day, they that were his owne, and are his owne by election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. even they have rejected him, the rout, and crowd, and the whole frame of the nation refuſed him, reſerving only ſome few: now did they refuſe Chriſt, and doe you thinke, that wee are privileged from this ſinne? are wee exempted from it? no ſurely, the Jewes for the maine body of them were unbeleevers, and are wee better than they? wee have the ſame corrupt natures, and they had the ſame meanes that wee enjoy; nay of them came the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and of them Chriſt came, yet they beleeved not in a Chriſt, therefore they are broken off, and ſo are gone from Chriſt, and ſo from eternall life; it is very true, Chriſt hath his time, wherein hee will reveale himſelfe to theſe againe, but as yet they are fallen off from Chriſt, though they had the truth; therefore what may wee thinke of our ſelves, and if any man thinke that we are better than the Jewes, conſider then what the Apoſtle

I know God hath his number every where where the Goſpell is, but there are many places where a man ſhall ſcarcely finde any one that hath true and ſaving faith or grace: the reaſons which eſpecially make the caſe cleare, are three, in which it is plaine, that this great worke is hard to bee found, even amongſt thoſe that enjoy the meanes; the firſt reaſon is this:</p>

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:4394:225"/> he is farre enough from it: this ſinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe is bred, and hath his abode in the bottome of the heart, and doth not ſo much expreſſe it ſelfe in the next worke, but in ſome baſer workes, and yet the root of unbeleefe is hid, the fruit, and leaves, and branches of a tree are ſeene, but the root and ſap of it is hid in the earth; ſo it is here, other corruptions breake forth amaine, as the drunkard ſtaggers in the ſtreets, the angrie man railes and rageth againſt Gods people, and the blaſphemer ecchoes and breaths out his oaths, that a man can ſcarcely have any wholeſome brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by him; and the covetous man oppreſſeth, and the poore complains of it, theſe are all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſinnes, and becauſe every man can ſee theſe, therefore hee is the more eaſily convinced of theſe, and ſaith, I confeſſe, it is ſo and ſo, but yet no man is without ſinne; &amp;c. but unbeleefe is like a cankar in the heart, it is bred in the bowels, and therefore a man is hardly convinced of it, and hardly made to ſet downe himſelfe this way, and to confeſſe, that he wants faith: and as this ſinne is moſt ſecret, ſo it is a kinde of ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and it hath a kinde of refined villany, and hath ſecret paſſages of its owne, as a man knowes not the way of a ſhip in the ſea, or diſcernes the ſliding of a ſerpent upon a ſtone: ſo alſo there is a kinde of ſpirituall ſliding away from God, and from the promiſe which is not ſeene to others, nay, ſcarcely can it be knowne to a mans ſelfe, all other corruptions are very troubleſome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet a man moſt wonderfully, as envie eats out

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, wee come to view and to ſee where he falls ſhort, now you ſee him: Oh, that the Lord would make him ſee himſelfe, and brethren obſerve thus much; few of theſe men are ever brought home by the powerfull preaching of the Goſpell; and the reaſon is, becauſe their owne wiſedome is beyond the miniſtery of the Word, and they ſay, ſuch a Miniſter is a good Scholer; but had hee that wiſedome, and thoſe parts, and the like: thus they reare up bulwarkes againſt the Word of truth, that it ſinkes not into their hearts; therefore to make this man knowne to himſelfe, obſerve thus much in the generall, the baſeneſſe of this mans faith, (for it is no better, but that he is deluded that he cannot ſee it) it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelfe thus: it is bred in his bookes, and in his judgement, and goes no further, and it is far
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:4394:234"/> from ſaving faith: therefore that the inditement may lie cleare, and that we may outbid him in his booke learning and all, know thus much, the maine ground of this mans miſtake may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thus: there are two things in the nature of faith: Firſt, illumination: Secondly, applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as wee tearme it; illumination not onely is, when a man hath the common rumours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of the truths of God, in the Goſpell, and knowes the reaſon of the texts, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſcriptures, this the reprobate may have, and this he hath; but there is alſo an operation of the Spirit upon the affections, and then there comes an application, wherein the ſoule goes out to the promiſe, and takes that for his good, which is thereunto appointed: now obſerve this judicious man, hee hath a generall apprehenſion of the truths of the Goſpell; but as for that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working upon the will, and to enter in upon the promiſes of God, and to have the ſap and ſweet of theſe, and to goe out to Chriſt, and to take all from Chriſt, he is a ſtranger to this, and it goes beyond all his booke learning; and hence it is that when the Miniſter comes to handle theſe points, he ſaith the Miniſter was ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to day; and the reaſon why he faith ſo, it is becauſe hee did not underſtand them; theſe men are ignorant in the ſpirituall turnings of the heart, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8, 9. when Chriſt came to teach <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> he was at a loſſe, and thought that Chriſt ſpoke without booke: therefore Chriſt reads the lecture againe and ſaith, I ſpeake of the ſpirituall worke,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:4394:234"/> 
                  <hi>that which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is borne of the Spirit is Spirit:</hi> Oh, ſaith he, how can theſe things be? he could not gainſay Chriſt, and yet becauſe hee could not underſtand it, therefore hee would not yeeld: ſo it is with this man, it befalls this man as it is with ſome wiſe Lawyer, hee reads over a mans writings and the leaſes, and hee rehearſeth the tenour upon which the lands are holden, and what right the man hath to them, hee layes open all the queſtions of the law, and he reads his name in the will, and yet he never reads his owne name there, nor any right that he hath to them: Juſt ſo it is with this judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious profeſſor, he is able to diſpute of the maine points of the Goſpell, and ſhewes that others have right to them, and he reads the writings, but never comes to partake of them himſelfe; as it was with the wiſe men that came to inquire for Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1, 2. verſes, the Scribes and Phariſees could tell you where Chriſt was to bee borne, and bid the wiſe men goe to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> but they would not goe themſelves: ſo theſe men have wiſedome enough to ſay, here is the way to Heaven; but their owne hearts are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled nor framed to walke in that way, and to goe home to Chriſt, nor to receive mercy from him. Know therefore you that are weake, that beleeving carries two things with it in the phraſe of Scripture: Firſt, the aſſent of a mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the truth, when a man is ſo farre convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that hee ſits downe, and acknowledgeth that whatſoever the Word hath revealed, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:4394:235"/> ſaith it is all true, and yeelds fully with the whole ſtreame of his minde, this is that which the Scripture ſometimes calls beleeving, and it is nothing but the bare aſſent to the truth, ſaying it is ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the will embraceth that good in the promiſe formerly revealed, when the will of a man claimes Gods Statutes, and caſts his heart and hope upon the goodneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Now the judicious profeſſour hath faith in the firſt ſenſe, hee aſſents to all the truths of the Scriptures, and acknowledgeth that they are true; the devills in hell have this faith too, and all that have no more than this faith, ſhall goe to the devill too, as <hi>Iames</hi> 2.19. in the 14. verſe, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>if a man ſay hee hath faith, and hath not workes, will that profit him:</hi> and in the 19. verſe; <hi>thou beleeveſt there is one God, thou doſt well, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils alſo beleeve and tremble;</hi> that is, they aſſent to all the truths of Scripture that God reveals, and this is the beleeving of this great man which wee have diſcovered in his faſhion, when a man can dive deepe into the Scriptures, and underſtand all the texts, and unty every knot, and diſpute all queſtions, and is able to judge of the reaſons of them, is this thy faith? the devill himſelfe will outbid this faith: If cunning, and judgement, and knowledge be thy faith, the devils have this faith, they know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of the moſt high God, they know that the mercy of the Lord Chriſt is great, and that they ſhall never taſte of it; they know
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:4394:235"/> that the Lord Jeſus ſhall bee the Judge of all the world, and that hee ſhall condemne them, they aſſent to it, and tremble at it. <hi>Marke</hi> 5.8. when our Saviour came amongſt the devils, they ſaid, <hi>We know thee who thou art, even the holy one of God;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 16.17. there was a Devill in a woman, which was a Diviner and a Witch, and ſhe ſaid, <hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the living God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation;</hi> it was the Devill in the woman, therefore the Apoſtle bad him goe out of her, becauſe he hindered their worke: I wiſh that the Devils in hell might not riſe up in judgement againſt many of our unbeleevers, which will not yeeld to the truth of God; this is the bottome which beares up that kinde of boldneſſe, which many carnall creatures have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their death-beds, which never had the power of grace in their ſoules. Come to a carnall man that knowes nothing ſavingly and ſanctifyingly, and he will ſay, I beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all my heart, I have admired at it, and ſought to know the bottome of it, and it is this, they thinke this is beleeving, to acknowledge that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come into the world, and that they are not infidels, they aſſent unto the truth, and yeeld unto it; in their judgements they thinke this is faith, and that it is ſufficient too: Oh you poore creatures that have your friends, or parents, or husbands, that thus lay hold upon Chriſt, and are perſwaded that this is faith; underſtand what the meaning is, they only aſſent to the truth, but never make application to their owne ſoules.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:4394:236"/> Whats that to thee that thou knoweſt the way to life and ſalvation, and never walkeſt in it? and whats that to thee, to heare that the Lord Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, and to know that there is mercie enough in him, and yet never partake of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I come to the evidences, which make it cleare to us, that he hath no more than this, and thoſe evidences are two:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, you ſhall finde this man paſt feare, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt careleſſe, but he is without doubt of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, either of getting or maintaining his faith; hee never comes to queſtion whether hee hath faith or no, and he accounts them ſilly Chriſtians, that are ſo daily troubled and diſquieted for their eſtates, whereas he carries the matter very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and ſcarcely lookes after it, but beares it out with marvellous boldneſſe and confidence, which in truth is an undoubted argument, that this man never knew what this faith was, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, for the gate is narrow that leadeth to life, and few there are that finde it;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> yet this man makes it a matter of nothing; nay, when many ſeeke and labour, and take much paines, and never attaine it, by reaſon of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength of it, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. <hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee;</hi> yet this man thinks to have it with a wet finger: that faith which is wrought by the Spirit of God in the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:4394:236"/> ſoule, and is thereby kept, it hath daily oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſoule, ſo that every godly man that hath faith, he muſt fight againſt the Devill, and all enemies and oppoſitions, yet this man never comes to blowes, the Lord Chriſt found it thus by experience, and thus the Apoſtles and the Saints of God found it, yet this man hath found out a ſhorter cut, and an eaſier way to heaven, and he is not aſhamed to confeſſe it, and ſay, If a man were exerciſed in the word, and if men had but his skill, and were but trained up in his ſchoole, it were not ſuch a hard matter to get faith, and ſo it is true, for they may eaſily get that faith which thou haſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, follow this man home, and cloſe with him in his private chamber and attend upon him in his other occaſions, and there he hath no power of godlineſſe in his life, he hath practice without any pith, and a courſe without any kernell, and hee performes ſuperficiall duties without any ſtrength; all his duties are as dry as a chip, only he carries all out with this, he is wiſe, and learned, and judicious, and this anſwers all; if hee doe omit or neglect duties, and doe them careleſly, this comforts him, that hee is a judicious man: it is certaine this man wants that grace, which he ſeemes to have, hee that hath ſo much faith without wavering, muſt needs have his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwerable, he that hath ſo much faith in his heart, muſt needs have a gracious and a godly life; if a man have much ſap within, and no ſigne of it without, it is certaine it is no true faith, as it is
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:4394:237"/> with a tree, the tree that hath much ſap in the root, will have much fruit in the branches, and the more ſap it hath, the more fruit it will have: looke as it is with the floud-gates, the wider the ſloud-gate is, the greater is the ſtreame which comes thorow it; ſo were thy faith the faith of Gods elect, then the more faith a man had to lay hold upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the more ſap and grace he would receive from Chriſt, and the greater would be the ſtreame of grace that would run out in all holy obedience, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but when a man brags that he hath much faith within, yet if his converſation be without pith and ſavour, it is nothing but a conceit, and an apprehenſion; as for the power of Chriſt, and the life of Chriſt, this man never knew it, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had it.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt ſort is the counterfeit, that hath a forged kinde of faith, in ſuch a manner, that they will ſometimes bee ready to couzen a holy judicious man, and themſelves too; they exceed all the former, and there is no diſputing of the difference betweene thoſe two that are paſt, and this man that followes; I told you that hee was a Chynicall, and an Alcumie man, and one that hath ſomething to ſay for himſelfe; hee hath the picture of faith drawne marvellous curiouſly, and he hath the appearance of ſome plea for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and he hath the reſemblance of this bleſſed worke, and that prettie lively too: of theſe there are three ſorts; one exceeds the other in degrees, and yet all fals ſhort of this bleſſed work of faith:</p>
               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:4394:237"/>
               <p>Firſt, the temporarie beleever, wee take him as the loweſt forme; a man is called a temporary bleever, that beleeveth for a time, and is hot at firſt hand, and admirable fierce in the purſuit of the truth, for the preſent puſh, but hee ſlides off, and goes away, and you ſhall ſee him no more; now that wee may deale home in the buſineſſe, for hee that will ſearch in a narrow caſe, cannot doe it ſuddenly: therefore ſuffer mee to lay this man open in three particulars: Firſt, we will give him audience, and heare what he can ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; hee ſhall come as it were into the open court, and plead his owne cauſe. Secondly, I will ſhew where he failes. Thirdly, give you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he fals ſhort.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, he ſhall diſcover it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond, the word ſhall lay it open.</p>
               <p>And for the third, I will ſhew you, how, and what he is.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, let the temporary ſpeake in his owne language, and put his plea in his owne behalfe, and give him but a faire hearing, and you ſhall have thus much of him; hee profeſſeth clearly, that hee hath not onely, as the judicious man had, an apprehenſion of the truth onely, and an aſſent that the Scriptures are cleare and true; but hee ſaith thus much, that his affections are carried on in a kinde of longing after it, and they are taken aſide, and ſtirred by the Word of the Lord, and both his heart and affections have a rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the goodneſſe of Gods word; this is his profeſſion, and he will make it good to you too;

                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:4394:239"/> this comes ſomething neere faith, and there is ſome colour for him to plead, that hee hath ſome confidence in God; there are three things in Scripture that he ſaith for himſelfe, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. the ſtony ground there is the temporarie, and the text ſaith two things of him, <hi>That he receives the word with joy, and beleeveth for a time;</hi> theſe two things are there averred, and are in the heart of this man; the receiving of the word with joy, is the tickling of the affections, with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſweetneſſe of the truth; and his beleeving, is not onely a bare aſſent to the truth, but a worke of the will in a kinde of hourlineſſe in application; theſe fall ſhort of the ſpirituall worke, namely thus, when the treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and holineſſe are laid open before the ſoule of a poore ſinner, and when the unſearchable riches of Gods love in Chriſt are let in, and come home to the heart of a ſtony ground hearer, the will is tickled therewith, and his inward man is ſtirred, and bedewed hourely with the ſweetneſſe thereof, this is the beleeving for a time; <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.35. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iohn was a burning and a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light, and you were willing for a ſeaſon to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in his light;</hi> one man that is at a loſſe, and out of his way, or another that is benummed and ſet with cold, the one ſeeth the fire, and is content to come to it to warme himſelfe, but when it burns him, away goes he; ſo they delighted in the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and it was pretty good while it was new, but when it begun to ſcorch, then they would heare him no more: thus it
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:4394:239"/> was with thoſe temporaries that flew off from Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.34. when Chriſt told them, <hi>that Moſes gave them not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven, for the true bread is hee which came downe from heaven; and giveth life to the world,</hi> and they ſaid, <hi>Lord evermore give us this bread;</hi> but they that would ever have of this bread, they ſoone after vomitted him up againe, and ſaid, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can beare it?</hi> the ſecond inſtance of Scripture is this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe that were once inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and have taſted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, &amp;c.</hi> this is ſuch a kinde of taſte, as may be and is in ſuch a man, as ſhall never have ſhare in life and ſalvation; as the Apoſtle afterwards makes it cleare, <hi>the heavenly gift is the grace of faith, and the good word of the Lord, is the goodneſſe of the word;</hi> I will open my ſelfe thus, obſerve that this taſte cannot be the taſte of the underſtanding proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for if hee were once inlightened, and hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ſaith the text, to ſay, inlightened, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened is without ſenſe, and makes a kinde of unreaſonableneſſe in the diſpute of the Apoſtle, and therefore it is ſomething more than the work of judging and aſſenting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not the diſgeſting of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gift, for this man hath onely the taſte of the heavenly gift, now a man may taſte of a precious liquor, and a man may ſip of a cordiall, that hath no power to make perfect uſe of it.</p>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:4394:240"/>
               <p>Againe, thirdly, it is a worke and ſtroke of the will and affections: here you may ſee the carnall hypocrite even almoſt at heaven, and yet he fals ſhort, and when he is in hell, he ſhall ſay, I had thought I was in heaven, and yet becauſe I have no faith, I am now caſt downe to hell; it is thus much, when the Lord lets in a glimpſe of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the grace of faith, and the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the ſweetneſſe of the pardon of all the ſinnes of the faithfull, and the Lord lets in a glimpſe of all theſe, which goes home to the top of the affections, and will that the Lord by a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kinde of flaſh, ſuddenly paſſeth by the will, ſo that he leaves ſome kinde of dew, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe glorious things, which are thus let in upon the minde of a poore ſinner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that his heart is marvellouſly tickled and raviſhed with it: I expreſſe it thus; as it is with the water in a ſtanding poole, and the water that runneth through a pipe; the ſtanding water ſoakes and goes down-ward, and ſettles inwardly in the earth, but the water that paſſeth by ſuddenly, leaves only a little dew behinde it, but ſoakes not at all; ſo it is with this temporary beleever, the ſtreame of the heavenly truths of the Doctrine of Chriſt paſſeth by ſuddenly, as namely, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, and that Chriſt came to take away the iniquitie of his ſervant, this doth paſſe by ſuddenly, and leaves a little dew behinde it; ſo that he ſaith, Oh this is good, this is ſweet! I may be ſaved too, may I not? Oh I never heard a man ſpeake ſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably:
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:4394:240"/> this word bedewes the heart a little, but it ſoakes not downe, it goes not to the root of the ſoule, &amp; therefore obſerve it: this is a work which the hypocrite may have, only obſerve thus much; he ſips of grace and ſalvation, and makes a meale of his corruptions; but the gracious man onely ſips of his corruptions, and makes a meale of grace, of holines, &amp; mercy in Chriſt, Looke as it is with ſeed that is caſt into the wombe of a woman, the ſeed is enough to beget ſome fruit; but if the wombe be a miſcarrying wombe, it comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: ſo it is betweene the ſtirring of the Word in the heart of a poore Saint, and in the heart of an Hypocrite; the Spirit of the Lord workes in the heart of a Hypocrite by the Word, and is able to moyſten him; but the heart miſcarries in the worke, and reſiſts, and gainſayes, and never comes to any good, hee never comes to bee a faithfull man rightly proportioned, whereas the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, working rightly upon the heart of a beleever, it makes him a very proportionable Chriſtian, the other remaining but a confuſed lumpe. Now ſee what this man may doe when he comes to this, let him bee thus bedewed with this taſte of the excellency of faith, and never have faith ſtrengthned and rooted in him, yet hee will bee very eager in the purſuit of the Word, and marvellous conſtant in attending upon the Word, becauſe it is his delight, and hee will bee marvellous painfull to get the Word; for a man will doe any thing to get his delight, and he may bee angry with ſuch as would hinder him in the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:4394:241"/> purſuit of the Goſpell, which is his delight; this a man may doe, and yet all come to nothing, and ſo may periſh everlaſtingly; for looke what joy and delight will doe for a puſh, the ſame a carnall temporary may doe. But that this man will doe all this it is plaine; of this kinde was <hi>Balaam</hi> that wretched man, of whom you may ſee divers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the 23. 24. chapters of <hi>Numbers:</hi> hee was a witch, as Divines hold, and hee was going to <hi>curſe the people of God;</hi> but the Lord ſtopt him, and how did he it? why, he let him ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the condition of the Saints of God, and ſaid, <hi>Oh thou wretched man, loe there and behold the happy condition of my people, and ſee all the good that I have given them, and wilt thou curſe thoſe that I love ſo dearly?</hi> Now ſee how he was taken up with it; <hi>Oh that I might die the death of the righteous!</hi> this was a glimpſe of the glory that was let in upon him, to ſtop him and to awe his heart, yet hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his old byas againe: the third Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in <hi>Matthew</hi> 25.8. I know Interpreters va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, but I will be bold to ſuggeſt what I thinke; the five fooliſh virgins ſaid, <hi>give us of your oyle, for our lampes are gone out:</hi> they had lamps but no oyle, how could they kindle their lamps except they had oyle? they had a little oyle in their lampes, but none in their veſſels; their lampes was their excellent and glorious profeſſion, and the oyle which they had was nothing but the taſte of the heavenly gift, they had ſo much ſtirring of the will and affections as might carry them on to profeſſe the truth, but they had not oyle in their
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:4394:241"/> veſſels which might ſink downe into their hearts, to ſubdue their corruptions, and to quicken up their grace, they had not this power to frame their hearts ſtrongly towards the Lord, and to feed their profeſſion with conſtancy and perſeverance to the end: ſo that you ſee what hee can ſay for himſelfe; and me thinkes he ſpeakes marvellous probably: The Lord bee mercifull to us, if a man goe thus farre, and come to nothing, it is wonderfull, he is farre beyond the judicious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor: Oh, ſaith he, I had a relliſh of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the good Word of God, and a taſte of the heavenly gift, and my heart was raviſhed with the ſight of the glory of it, and I could even have gone to Heaven; now you ſee the beſt of him.</p>

Had you told me of ſhame and diſgrace, and miſeries which I now finde, I could have told how to anſwer you, and how to order all my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; when the Sunne riſeth hot upon him, and troubles and afflictions befall him, then hee leaves Chriſt Jeſus and all, rather than hee will part with his comforts and eaſe, and the like: thus it is in <hi>Matthew</hi> 8.19. A certaine Scribe ſeeing Chriſt like to prove a great man, and thinking to have a good booty out of him, he ſaid, <hi>I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee whither ſoever thou goeſt:</hi> he thought Chriſt would bee preferred, and if I can but get under his wings, I ſhall be a made man for ever. Take heed what thou doſt, ſaith our Saviour, if thou wilt follow mee, thou muſt take all miſeries that come: I have not a bed for my ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou want one, thou muſt be content: <hi>The
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:4394:242"/> Foxes have holes, and the Fowles of the aire have neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head:</hi> ſo hee was gone, and wee heare no more of him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground upon which he commonly departs is this; when the good Word of the Lord comes home cloſe to his heart, and reads the blacke ſide as well as the white ſide; when the Word of God purſues him home to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſhewes his ſinnes, and diſcovers his baſe practices, and tells him thus; it is true there is mercy and ſalvation enough to be had in Chriſt, but there is none for ſuch as will not part with all for Chriſt, nor for thoſe that will not loſe all to finde and entertaine Chriſt. Now when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter comes to ſhake this mans hold, and to tell him, you follow after Chriſt for the loaves, your profeſſion is faire, but your heart is naught; there is no ſound worke nor ſaving grace wrought, all that you have done is loſt and come to nothing; then hee is profeſly at daggers drawing with the truth of Chriſt, and ſaith, what is it all come to this? This man doth not preach as hee was wont to doe; what mercy was he wont to diſcover, and what conſolations would hee reveale to all the poore ſervants of God? he preacheth now as if he would vex men, and not comfort them: as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.34. The Diſciples were very deſirous to have their meat dreſt for them; and Chriſt ſaith to them, I will doe it for you; <hi>the bread of God is he which commeth downe from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world;</hi> Oh, ſaid they, Lord evermore
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:4394:243"/> give us of this bread; well, ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall have enough of it, <hi>I am that bread of life, hee that commeth to me ſhall never hunger, and he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, ſhall never thirſt; he that eateth my fleſh ſhall never hunger:</hi> the fleſh profiteth nothing the words that I ſpeake, <hi>they are Spirit and they are Life;</hi> this muſt be done by faith ſpiritually: now marke theſe men in the 60. verſe, they fall to open quarrelling and oppoſing; <hi>this is an hard ſaying, who can beare it?</hi> as if hee had ſaid, you deſired evermore to have of this bread, but you muſt bee humble and feed upon me by faith, and lay downe all confidence in parts and gifts: Oh, then they loathed this bread, and care not for it, it will not downe; this is bread that no man can digeſt; what, thus holy and thus heavenly minded, to man can endure it: So from that day forward they went away. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15, 16. the <hi>Galathians</hi> there did entertaine the Word of the Lord mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous contentedly, and their hearts were ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed therewith, inſomuch that they could have beene even content <hi>to pluck out their eyes to doe the Apoſtle good,</hi> and yet preſently after, they would have pluckt the ſoule from his body, and all this was becauſe hee would not dally with them, nor nouriſh them in their ſinnes, but ſpoke the truth which would have pluckt away their corruptions from them. When the Prophet came to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes houſe, and bade her take meale out of the barrell, and draw oyle out of the cruiſe, all the while that this laſted he was welcome; but when the childe died, ſhe ſaith, <hi>Oh, thou man of God, art

               <p>Secondly, he failes in his application of the promiſe, for the ground upon which he goes, or the cauſe and reaſon which carries him to roame after the promiſe, it is onely the generall notice of mercie, and of the ſalvation that God offers, the glimpſe and the ſhine whereof being let in upon the heart, and paſſing by, jogs the ſoule, and ſo the heart ſnatcheth at it, he comes to heare the abundance of mercie, and the rich redemption, and plentifull goodneſſe of Chriſt to pardon all ſinnes, (the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt onely

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:4394:246"/> the world, and hee ſeeth more certainty in the good of the promiſe, than in all the good things here below; and therefore he will rather loſe all than the promiſe, and will rather truſt to the goodneſſe of God in the promiſe, than to any thing elſe beſides; though riches bee never ſo great, and honours never ſo glorious, yet the faithfull ſoule knowes that the world promiſeth much, and performes little, and it couſens us; but the Lord is true in all his promiſes, and what he hath promiſed, the ſoule beleeves: therefore ſaith he, though my ſenſe, and taſte, and all faile, and if many ſorrowes and miſeries come, yet I will reſt upon the promiſe; for there is a greater good in the promiſe, than in all the world beſides: to this I may adde the other, which I call the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged hypocrite, as there are too many of them in theſe dayes, ſuch as heretofore have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a faire ſayle in the wayes of godlineſſe; but when his honour and credit dies, hee goes away: ſome have died for griefe, they are all to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this ground; ſo long as the winde laſted he ſtayed it out, but now hee is not able to hold up his head, unleſſe he be lifted up by the chinne, and by the comfort of his profeſſion: but he that is a gracious man, though all the frame of Heaven and Earth ſtagger, yet he is ſupported and beares up himſelfe upon the promiſe, if it bee a ſaving worke: I know he may ſtagger, yet hee recovers himſelfe, and at laſt lifts up himſelfe upon the promiſe. A skilfull ſwimmer uſeth his bladders, but yet if they faile, hee recovers himſelfe upon
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:4394:247"/> the ſtreame, and beares up himſelfe upon that: ſo the gracious heart is content to uſe comforts, and contentments, and whatſoever hee hath to beare him up with more eaſe; yet if all theſe blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders breake, and if all friends, and meanes, and honours goe, and if heaven and ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man ſturdily proud may give way to be burnt, and to dye for faction, &amp;c. hee dyes onely to content his owne proud heart, not becauſe God requires it, and that God may be honoured, but only in ſturdineſſe of heart, and becauſe he will dye in that profeſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath beene brought up.</p>

Take a man that is ingenuous and hath a ſtout heart of his owne, haply he is called to battle, and he ſcornes to be outbraved by any man; but when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevaile this way, yet by fawning and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, you ſhall turne him which way you will; the onely way is to flatter him.

We have an old parable of a traveller; the winde though it blew and bluſtered, yet it could not pull away his cloake, but hee held it ſo much the faſter; but when the Sun ſhined hot upon him, he threw off his cloake and coat and all: when a man hath no honours, then perſecution makes him hold the cloſer to the truth, but when the fine gleames of honour and profit come, and a man is lifted up into fools paradiſe, he puts off all religion and honeſty: the ſturdy hypocrite may die for the truth, and yet all out of a ſturdy ſpirit,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe proſperity hath a great power to couſen and delude a mans judgement, it comes cunningly and ſlides into the ſoule, and ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens him: as the wiſe man ſaith, bribes blinde the eyes of the wiſe, all his heart is upon the bribe; and though the cauſe be never ſo bad, yet it ſeemes good when ſo many peeces come to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it over: even ſo here proſperity bribes the ſoules of poore creatures; the heart takes the bribe, and the underſtanding playes the lawyer, and pleads for it in this manner, and ſaith, now he is better informed, and he knowes more than hee did, and he is better adviſed The: Engliſh is thus much, he hath put on the ſpectacles of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hee hath ſeene a good living, or a good wife, and theſe bribe him, hee ſaw not theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore theſe did not trouble him, but now hee hath ſeene them, certainly that muſt needs be good, that hath all theſe profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to plead for it: As the holy Ghoſt ſaith,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:4394:251"/> 
                  <hi>Man in honour vnderstands not;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, honour and proſperity blinde the underſtanding and bribe the minde of a man. They that are now and then overtaken with drink, may eaſily be cheated, and it is no wonder though they be, for they are not themſelves: ſo a man may be drunke with the world, and with honours, and if hee be now and then couſened, you can looke for no other. This is the reaſon of all thoſe faire kinde of colours which men put over their courſes, they confeſſe their judgements were ſo indeed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but now they have had learned counſell, that is, from their parts, and eaſe, and honours, &amp;c. And ſhall I doe ſuch a thing? and ſhall I walke in ſuch a way? and they tell him there is great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and it is good law: thus a man is tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken aſide moſt fearfully; nay here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity puts a pretence of a great deale of good that a man may doe in the Church; and a great deale of honour, he may bring to God; and hence they ſay, a man of ſuch parts, and ſuch iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and holineſſe, if hee were a man of place, what a world of ſervice might he doe to God, and to the Church, the world could not miſſe him; nay it is ten thouſand pities that a man of ſuch parts and gifts ſhould not bee in high place; the Church miſſeth much good by the ſhift, and God loſeth much honour. The meaning is, he loſeth much honour, this couſens a mans judgement, when that which is the argument within a man is profit, or eaſe, or the like, whereas perſecution doth no ſuch matter; for in the time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:4394:251"/> then a good cauſe appeares more plainly, and a naughty cauſe appeares more vilde. A man in perſecution is not drunke, he is himſelfe, and therefore hee is able to paſſe ſentence as they doe deſerve: perſecution comes like an open enemy, and a man is aware of it, and therefore prepares for it; but proſperity comes like a traitour, and ſuddenly ſtabs us before wee are aware of it.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved in nature, if the fiſhers goe and ſhew the bare hooke onely, the fiſh will flie from it, but when it is baited, then the fiſh will runne to it: ſo the bait of proſperity deludes a man, and he is deceived therewith, and is taken aſide from the power and profeſſion of the truth: <hi>Iudges</hi> 4.17. <hi>Baracke purſued Siſera, but hee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him not;</hi> and the reaſon was this, <hi>hee was not at peace with Baracke, but hee was at peace with Iael, and therefore ſhe cunningly ſlew him:</hi> ſo here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is a good bleſſing, and eaſe, and honour, and peace, theſe are all our friends, and wee are at peace with them: therefore theſe wound our hearts, and breake our neckes in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as our judgements come moſt of all to he couſened thereby, ſo it is that which deads our affections, and kils our diligences, and takes off the edge of our endevours, and makes us dead and ſluggiſh in a Chriſtian courſe, and hence it is that wee are deſperately overthrowne thereby: perſecution and trouble makes a man ſeeke more diligently, and crie and pray more earneſtly, and labour more exactly than before, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:4394:252"/> ſeeking to God for ſuccour, he receiveth more ſuccour from the Lord, againſt all theſe troubles and trials: <hi>David</hi> was never tempted to that baſe luſt in the wilderneſſe, when hee was purſued by <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe then he ſought daily to the Lord, and had aid and ſuccour from him; but when he was at eaſe in his houſe, then he grew dead hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and careleſſe, and was overcome in proſperity: men truſt to themſelves, and therefore they are foiled, but now perſecutions and troubles make a man ſee himſelfe helpleſſe in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and therefore he goes to the Lord, and ſo is ſupported and ſuccoured by the Almighty, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.16. <hi>Lord in trouble have they viſited thee, they powred forth a prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them;</hi> God cannot be viſited in the time of proſperity, when we are full and aforehand, but in the time of adverſitie and perſecution, then they will powre forth their prayer, not drop out an idle lazie prayer, but pray with fervencie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and ſo finde favour; ſo the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> complaines, <hi>I have ſpoken to thee in thy youth, but thou haſt denied to heare mee;</hi> in our adverſity, then Gods mercie and truth may take ſome place in our hearts, but in the time of proſperitie, then we turne the deafe care upon him, and we thinke wee have enough of our ſelves, as it is with the trees, the winde ſhaketh them, and ſo the ſap comes more to the root, and it ſettles more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the earth; but now if there comes a great drought, or an exceeding heat, that doth take away both ſap and root, and all: ſo when the ſoule
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:4394:252"/> is ſhaken and tottered with the winde of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and temptation, the ſoule is ſettled more deeply upon the promiſe, for the guiding of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a good way; but eaſe, and peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, dry up a mans endevours, and all the ſap of grace and good which formerly a man ſeemed to have; then if it bee ſo that proſperitie bribes the judgement and couzens us, and if by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie our care and diligence is deaded, no wonder then though honour and caſe prevaile ſo much againſt us, to hinder us more than perſecutions can doe: thus you ſee this mans falſeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now the evidences whereby he diſcovers his falſeneſſe, they are two: and it is pretty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how his baſeneſſe within will diſcover it ſelfe without; the firſt is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, you ſhall finde him to maintaine his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and his profeſſion too, the world carries him, he muſt have that, and yet his profeſſion muſt not bee caſt away, hee will have Chriſt and eaſe, Chriſt and honour, he holds both in hand, and he divides his forces, he will be a profeſſour, and yet be baſe in the world, and in his profits too, and you cannot take away either, he keepes a ſtall in both markets, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. it is ſaid there, that the thornie ground brought forth no fruit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>it brought forth fruit, but the thornes did choake it,</hi> and ſo it brought forth nothing to any perfection; as it is in the thorny ground, the come haply hath a full eare with all the graine of it, and is as greene as a leeke, but it continues not greene ſtill, and comes not to ripeneſſe and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:4394:253"/> becauſe the thornes choake it; ſo this man hath his full eare, and is as greene as a leeke: you will faſt and pray, ſo will he; you will profeſſe, ſo will he; you will conferre holily, ſo will he in the outward appearance, but he never comes to good, becauſe he beſtowes the ſtrength of his affections upon the world, or upon ſome baſe luſts; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beat this man to lay downe his profeſſion, and to make him ſay, I confeſſe I am dead, and my heart is vilde, and my profeſſion is nothing but hypocriſie, no, hee will have his profeſſion and his corruption too: thus obſerve the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when a Chriſtian comes into his ſhop, hee will tell him a fine religious diſcourſe, and ſo in the end couzen him; and if a vilde wretch comes in, he hath another tale for him, hee joynes with him, onely that hee may put a crackt commodity into his hand, and he joynes with the good man, that hee may couzen him too: ſo the Inkeeper, when a Chriſtian comes to his houſe, hee tels him a fine religious tale; and if a drunkard comes it, he gives him his full meaſure; thus his thornes grow, and his corne too, hee holds his profeſſion, and his corruptions too.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond evidence of this mans falſneſſe is this, he is weather-wiſe, that is, he obſerves how the ſtate of things ſtand, and hee gives a ſhrewd gueſſe which way the winde and tide will goe, and he will be ſure to goe that way, and to be on that ſide, he ſees the winde begin to riſe, and the ſtormes to bluſter, therefore he will provide and ſhift for one, and doe any thing, provided that
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:4394:253"/> his honour and eaſe may not be loſt, he will be of that ſide, that the thornes of profit and pleaſure may not be plowed up, and therefore it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thoſe things which may hazzard his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he will not by his good will queſtion them, but he carries out the matter bravely before him: ſo long as a man may have the ſubſtance, ſaith he, that is, Chriſt and religion, hee would not have men to trouble themſelves about leſſer matters; but the Lord Chriſt ſaith, hee that is unfaithfull in the leaſt, is unfaithfull in much, and hee that makes not conſcience of the ſmaller circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will not make conſcience of the ſubſtance, and if hee bee compeld to enquire, and to make queſtion of his courſe, he will be ſatisfied by thoſe ſhewes, and that argument ſhall content him, which may content his honour, and maintaine his eaſe, and honour, and liberty, and hee goes away well apaid and fully quieted, and when this man is put to it, and the dent of the truth daſheth all thoſe probable truths of his, then his laſt hold is this, he doth not beleeve it, and he cannot thinke it, but if you cannot beleeve and entertaine that which you cannot anſwer, then it is a ſigne that thy heart is naught; and if a man follow him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, if a man ſet himſelfe, and lift up himſelfe, and his conceits againſt the truth of God, that mans heart is naught, then ſaith he, all the Miniſters under heaven ſhall not make me beleeve it, but when hee can ſay nothing againſt the truth, he will keepe his hold ſtill, and he will not beleeve it; thus you ſee this man at his full
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:4394:254"/> breadth and height: as it is with a plow, that goes to plow up a thorny tree, they tug, and pull, and make the traces flye, and breake the plow, but the tree ſtands ſtill, it will not yeeld; ſo it is with this wretched hypocrite, all the reaſons in the world, and all the truths cannot prevaile with him, he is reſolved to ſtand to it, and not to beleeve it: wilt thou not now beleeve it? well, thou ſhalt beleeve it when thou art in hell, paſt hope, paſt helpe, thou wilt beleeve it then, thus the thornes choake the word, that is, ſtrangle the truth, and ſtop the breath of the truth, ſo hee ſaith, I paſſe not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it not, this ſtifles all reaſons, and the power of all Scriptures, that all prevailes not with him, nor takes no place in him, to make him know what it is to be a grower in the truth: by this time I preſume you may eaſily gueſſe at him what his faſhion is, and what hee can ſay for himſelfe, and wherein his falſeneſſe lyes, and whereſoever you finde theſe, that both the corne and the thornes grow together, and that hee doth thus as in the former two, then this man is one of the ſturdy hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the third thing, namely, to ſhew wherein this man fals ſhort of ſaving faith, that a man that ſeeth it, may amend when he comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and that he may not faile as the former have done: the failing of this man appeares in two particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee failes in the point of humiliation, hee was not rightly humbled, as in that place of the parable, hee had horrour of heart enough for the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:4394:254"/> meaſure of it, but not enough for the uprightneſſe and ſincerity of it, hee plowed deep enough, but he left ſome thornes ſtanding, and hee had ſome luſts that his heart was more affected with, hee would not be thus, but there were ſome baſe, inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, earthly affections, which were cloſely faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his heart, and his heart glued to them, hee would not plow them up, and this was ill husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, if he had done right, he would have plowed up every thorne as well as ſome: all the paſſages of Scripture run this way, as <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. <hi>Every valley ſhall be filled, and every hill and mountaine ſhall bee brought low, and every crooked thing ſhall bee made ſtrait;</hi> hee doth not ſay, this or that mountaine, but every mountaine; not one ſinne, but every ſinne; not the heart to bee looſened from one particular ſinne, but from every ſinne whatſoever; if ever you bee humbled, and that you make worke of it, you muſt blow up all, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. <hi>the wiſe merchant man went and ſold all to buy the field;</hi> not ſold ſome, but all; ſo this ſturdy hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſhould have ſold all his luſts and corruptions, and every curſed haunt of heart, and every ſinfull withdrawing of ſoule: you know the privie prankes of your hearts, if there be but one ſinfull luſt maintained and continued in, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you as well as an hundred thouſand: there is no bargaine to be made with Chriſt, if you dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him and ſtand dodging, he will not yeeld to you, no, no, you muſt ſell all, this man had his heart humbled in the conſideration of ſome ſinne, and it was either for the feare of the puniſhment
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:4394:255"/> of his ſinne in generall, or elſe for feare of plague, and of hell, and of Gods wrath, or elſe becauſe of the ſhame and diſgrace that would come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but if he had beene truly troubled for ſinne, becauſe it is the breach of Gods commandments, then every ſinne would have ſtrucke upon his heart, and troubled him; thus it is with the heart rightly torne up by the law, but if it have onely here a bauke and there a bauke, then it is baſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and you will never have harveſt nor hope of mercie upon this ground, but if a man play the good husband, he muſt plow up all, from one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his conſcience to the other, and from the beginning of his heart to the ending, there muſt be no corruption ſetled, but hate ſinne as ſinne, and therefore every ſinne, this is the temper of the ſoule that the Lord will doe good unto, and here is the failing of moſt unſound hearts, many religious men and profeſſours too, what they bee the Lord knowes, they will dally with this ſinne and that ſinne, but a true broken heart ſhakes at the leaſt ſinne more than at all puniſhments, and had rather endure the torments of hell, than that the leaſt ſinne ſhould be committed by him; this is a good heart which makes good worke of it, and herein this hypocrite failes, ſo that though he had legall terrour enough, for the meaſure of it, yet it was not right for the manner of it, for it could not bee any ſaving worke of grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs bee a terror for ſinne, and yet the heart never truly humbled, nor never plowed in peeces by the law, and by the worke
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:4394:255"/> of Gods grace, thereby fitting the heart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly and laſtly, he failes in making choice of Chriſt, he did not chuſe whole Chriſt, it is one part of faith, and that which is included in reſting, the ſoule that truly embraceth Chriſt, he takes the good of Chriſt, and the death, and perſecution, and the death of Chriſt, and whatſoever comes with him; now here in the ſturdy hypocrite failes, and this is the maine wound of him: the ſoule that makes choice of Chriſt aright, is reſolved to match with Chriſt, and that nothing ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from it; now this hypocrite would not match with Chriſt, but onely trade with him, ſo much as may mediate for him, and bee a meanes that he may enjoy his beloved honours, and ſo much profeſſion, and ſo much of Chriſt he would have, whereas the faithfull ſoule matcheth with Chriſt, and trades with the world; if honours will advance Chriſt, and if riches will make for Chriſt, and if his libertie will worke in him a free heart to ſerve God, then the faithfull ſoule will trade with them, but this wretch will onely trade with Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt ſtand at the doore, this is the cauſe why, when he profeſſeth the truth of the Lord Jeſus, if a better match comes in the way, he takes it, and leaves Chriſt: only thus much briefly; this thornie wretch takes Chriſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The laſt ſort of counterfeits, which is the chiefe and the upſhot of all, is him, whom I call the ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtately hypocrite, he is a man that doth carry a marvellous high ſtraine, and goes with a great ſaile in the profeſſion of the truth, as the maſter cut-purſe in his outſide ſeemes to be a man of no ſmall account nor meane place, in regard of his attendants, apparell, and he will ruffle it out in his ſilkes and velvets, as if hee were ſome great Gentleman of the country, and yet he is a baſe vilde wretch; ſo it is with this baſe ſhifting hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: there are two paſſages in his life, and I uſe to call him by theſe two names, Shifting, and ſtately, he had all that the ſturdy hypocrite had, and he alſo goes beyond him in the ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his courſe and practice, he is a fine ſpun hypocrite, and hath not only an ordinary colour of profeſſion, but he layes on a ſeven-fold gilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his courſe and profeſſion, ſo that as it is with

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, wherein this man doth exceed the former, that you may ſee the full proportion of him, hee doth profeſly ſtand in compariſon with the former, and exceeds them too; and therefore he will trie the buſineſſe with him, and view with him; and what the other could ſay, hee ſaith the ſame and more too: the ſturdy Hypocrite had his conſcience awakened, ſo hee had his heart awakened with a witneſſe, and the Lord not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called and rapt, but knockt hard at the doore: and for Chriſt, he hath ſeene ſo much beauty and excellency in Chriſt, that hee will lay downe his blood for him, thus farre the ſturdy Hypocrite went: but now this ſtately Hypocrite outgoes the former in three particular ſteps or degrees,</p>
               <p>Firſt, he hath not onely ſo much ſtrength that he is able to beare perſecutions, and not to bee daunted, as the former had; but hee hath that wiſedome and ſtrength of underſtanding, that he
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:4394:257"/> is able to paſſe by, and to caſheere the honours, and riches, and preferments of the world, and all the renowne of all the high places in the world, ſo that proſperity, I meane all the honours and preferments of the world, are not able to prevaile with him. Oh, ſaith hee, the ſturdy Hypocrite was a foole, and was caught with the bait; but I ſee the bait in all theſe profits and commodities, and I am able to judge of the baſeneſſe of all worldly things, and therefore I am not overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them: I know better than is in all theſe, if you goe no further than liberty, profit, eaſe, and worldly preferment; this Hypocrite hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than all theſe, as namely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and beauty of the common graces which God hath wrought in him, and whereby God hath made him able to doe ſome duties, in theſe he puts a greater excellency and confidence, than in Chriſt: this is marvellous eaſie and apparant, even amongſt the Heathens themſelves. Many of the Heathens themſelves have beene ſo farre taken up with the admiration at, and affecting of morall vertues, one man with patience, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with temperance, they have been ſo taken up in meditation, and in the admiration of theſe, that they have trampled upon crownes, and have harſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of all the honours of the world: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeeches of the Heathen wee have to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as that, when one ſaid, honours, riches, &amp;c. cannot properly be ſaid to be good, for then they would make him good which hath them: as wee ſee wiſedome makes a man wiſe that hath it; but
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:4394:257"/> they that have riches and honours, for the moſt part are moſt wicked and vilde wretches; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely the wiſe man is the happy man, and an ignorant man is a miſerable man; therefore hee ſeeing the excellency of, and putting a high price upon theſe morall vertues, this hath made them put a high price on the one, and trample on the other.</p>
               <p>Now if Heathen men may be ſo farre taken up with theſe morall vertues, which have onely the light of nature to guide them, and never had the knowledge of Chriſt to drive them beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that yet they will doe all this; then a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may come to ſee a greater beauty than is in all theſe, when they come from the Spirit of grace; for the Heathens had but the very ſhell and outſide of theſe, but the Hypocrite knowes the vertue and benefit of theſe, and the eternall good that will come by theſe, this hee is able to diſcerne, and therefore hee is able to put a high price upon theſe, and it is no wonder; when the people came to make <hi>Saul</hi> King, <hi>hee hid himſelfe amongst the ſtuffe,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.22. as if hee were unworthy of the kingdome: ſo that a man may for by-ends caſt off preferment, and eaſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, whereas the ſturdy hypocrite tooke up a fine cold temper, and an ordinary path in a Chriſtian courſe, this hypocrite ſcornes that, and he is a profeſt enemy to lukewarmneſſe, and to a lazy carnall diſcretion in a Chriſtian courſe. This is the zeale and forwardneſſe of this man; but
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:4394:258"/> miſtake me not, for I doe not ſpeake this to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten a good cauſe, or the zeale and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any good man, no, God forbid; nay, let that tongue faulter, and curſed be the head that contrives, or the mouth that ſpeakes any thing againſt the zeale and forwardneſſe of any man in any good cauſe: the way is warrantable and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and muſt be done; for though meere morall vertues will not ſave a Chriſtian, yet without them no man ſhall ever come to Heaven: but I ſpeake all this to ſhew that all this may bee done, and yet all be ſtarke naught. I doe not ſpeake this to diſcourage any man, for you ſee I commend of this man, hee is not ſwept downe from the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of his profeſſion, as the ſturdy hypocrite was, by the taile of the Dragon; but he maintains his profeſſion with credit, and is zealous in it, he goes for a marvellous broken hearted Chriſtian, he ſcornes to be a linſey-woolſey-man, halfe one and halfe of another, hee ſtands in the open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the truth, and dares ſide with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ſaith as <hi>Iehu, who is on my ſide, who?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. <hi>Come ſee my zeale which I have for the Lord of Hosts;</hi> thus it was with <hi>Paul; Gal.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>He profited above many of his brethren in the Iewiſh religion, being more exceeding zealous of the traditions of the Fathers:</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7. he was a Phariſee, and <hi>concerning zeale, he perſecuted the Church; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the righteouſneſſe of the Law, he was blameleſſe; and theſe he counted gaine:</hi> This was all the gaine that <hi>Paul</hi> had, namely, that hee had ſuch parts, and gifts, and abilities to doe duties; this was all
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:4394:258"/> his gaine: and becauſe hee had all theſe, hee thought he muſt needs goe to Heaven: nay, nay, it is harder to goe to Heaven than you thinke, for it is another manner of worke than ſo: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hindrance that ever <hi>Paul</hi> had in his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the carnall confidence which hee had in himſelfe, there he ſtucke.</p>
               <p>Now wherein doth the falſeneſſe of this man appeare? I anſwer, Amongſt many others it diſcovers it ſelfe moſt groſly and notoriouſly in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſhall finde that as for leſſer ſinnes, the reformation of which might ſpoile him in the venting of his commodities, and marring his market, that he cannot ſet himſelfe, his parts and commodities at ſale; he will ſlight thoſe ſinnes, and make no account of them, and ſwallow them downe without any chewing; becauſe ſuch as theſe bee, would hinder him in his trading, that hee could not vent and ſhew himſelfe; and hee makes no great matter of them: this is for his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward practice.</p>
               <p>But if a mans exactneſſe in a Chriſtian courſe be ſincere, then he will be exact in all things; but if his exactneſſe may give way to ſome ſinne, then it is but hypocriſie, it is but a cloake and no ſoundneſſe at all: why doſt thou heare, and pray, and take up duties, though theſe muſt bee done, if thy duties bee ſincere, and if thou loveſt duties abroad, thou wilt love them at home too: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hereby we know that wee know him, if we keepe his Commandements; if a man keepe all the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:4394:259"/> Commandements of God, then he ſhall ſavingly know God; and hereby hee ſhall know that he knowes God:</hi> this is a ſigne that ſaving faith is there, becauſe it makes a man keepe all the Commandements of God; but curſed bee that prayer which ſeems to ſet it ſelfe againſt ſinne, and yet gives allowance unto ſinne. That prayer and performance which maintaines ſinne, is accurſed, and God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accept of it: this is for his out ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though this hypocrite be very exact, and expreſſe much power of religion in the world, yet follow this wretch home, and dog him to his owne heart and cloſet, and there you ſhall finde him not onely living in, but maintaining ſome ſinne, either in his practice, or elſe in others: as when hee was abroad, hee would ſwallow downe ſuch ſmaller ſinnes as would hinder him in the venting of himſelfe: ſo at home hee maintaines ſome diſtemper either in his family, or in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. A man out of the ſtrength of parts, and the excellency of his judgement, and the ability that God hath beſtowed upon him, may doe this, that whereſoever he comes, he will comfort and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and exhort and pray with others: theſe are good duties, I doe not diſcommend them: but he returnes home, and is churliſh, and dogged, and cruell to his ſervants, and takes up a pang of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will bee upon the houſe top for every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, and this is conſtant too, this is the bane of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and profeſſion. Of this ſtraine are thoſe that for their parts and gifts are marvellous large, and they will goe from this houſe to that houſe
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:4394:259"/> to pray, and yet never pray in their owne families, nor never humble themſelves before God; as if the performance of a ſervice publikely, could abate all the reſt in ſecret: It was not for his ſtate to pray privately in his cloſet, but onely amongſt others; ſome of theſe we have heard of, and we make no queſtion but there are more of this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if you know any ſuch, either make them revoke theſe things, or elſe caſheere them; the ſervant haply is religious, and therefore he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he will not dwell but where he may have liberty to heare, and he will indent with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and miſtres, that he will have the fellowſhip and communion of ſuch and ſuch; this is all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and I love ſuch a heart: but marke now when they returne home they are idle, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, and ſturdy, and they are maſters and miſtreſſes, and will not bee governed, and their plea is this; My maſter is a carnall man, my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres is a carnall woman; but if they are carnall, the Commandement is ſpirituall, and the duties injoyned are holy: and therefore thoſe prayers of thine which maintaine thy ſinne, will one day be an accuſation againſt thee, but will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy conſcience: this is not true religion; all your ſetting your ſelves to ſale, and all your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſhewes and reformations, it is not all worth a ruſh, unleſſe there bee the diſcharge of all thoſe duties that God requires: If there were ſaving faith, and if ever thy ſoule reſted upon Jeſus Chriſt, hee would inable thee to all duties, as well as one, and cauſe thee to make conſcience in
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:4394:260"/> all, as well as in one; faith would make thee ſhew forth the power of godlineſſe, guiding thee, faith would make thee pray in private as well as in publike; <hi>For as faith doth crucifie the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>ſo alſo it makes a man a new creature:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>It makes a new husband, a new wife, as well as a new Christian:</hi> therefore let them profeſſe what they will, follow them home to their houſes and cloſets, and you ſhall finde them to bee errand theeves and robbers, and rob God of his glory, the Lord of Heaven will finde out ſuch, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them continuing ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this is that which cuts the finewes, and ſinkes the heart of this hypocrite, this will put him to the triall, more than ever any thing did; this is that which will goe to the quicke, and make him appeare what hee is, and either finde him ſound, or elſe flie off altogether. If there come another Chriſtian of the ſame ranke and place, that exceeds him in parts and abilities, ſo that this man is not eſteemed, and his commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not regarded, this touches his freehold; if it were in the matter of honours or riches, he would not care: but now when he ſees his light to grow dimme and darke, and no man hath an eye to him, and his commodity growes naught, then this mans heart is quaſhed, hee is weary of the name and preſence of that man, and loth to bee in his company, and loth to doe any thing while hee is there, and hee wiſheth ſecretly that ſuch a man had never come to the towne: whats the reaſon of it? becauſe before this man came, his commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:4394:260"/> went off eaſily, and hee was reſpected for his parts and gifts: And marke what followes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will humble him, and bring him upon his knees, or elſe he will fall off from his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all, and will rather be content to be a baſe varlet, than to have no credit: If the Lord breake his heart and humble him, bleſſed bee his Name for it; but if God doe not humble him, but that he falls off, then he commonly proves an enemy to Religion, and God, and Goſpell, and all goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, this hypocrite fals ſhort of ſaving faith, as in all the former things before mentioned of the ſturdy hypocrite, as namely, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly humbled, hee was never effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Spirit of the Father to reſt upon his free grace in Chriſt, and hee did not make a right choyce of Chriſt: for if hee had ſeene an abſolute need of Chriſt, then hee would have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Chriſt more than all parts and gifts, becauſe hee had gotten Chriſt which was better than all his abilities; but he hath made a match with his ſervices and abilities, and hath only traded with Chriſt; he faild in all theſe, but the maine wound of this hypocrite lies here, hee reſts not upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but upon his owne bottomes, and his owne abilities and performances, which God inables him to diſcharge, and ſo he fals ſhort of a Saviour.</p>
               <p>All this will not doe the deed, brethren, it is not rowing but landing which will doe the deed; it was the guiſe of thoſe wretched Hypocrites in
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:4394:261"/> 
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.3. they plead with God, and begin to wrangle, becauſe he heard them not, and ſaid, <hi>Why have we faſted, and thou regardeſt it not?</hi> as if they had ſaid, Thou muſt needs doe it, what ſhall I weep ſo much, and knocke my breſt ſo hard, and crie out, and turne to the Lord, and will not all this doe the deed? no, for if thou couldſt howle till thy mouth failed, and goe mourning all thy dayes, and goe howling downe to the grave, if thou haſt not Chriſt in all theſe, it will never doe thee any good: what availes it a man to ſaile up and downe in the ſhip, and can never get to land? he muſt certainly periſh if he have no comfort: ſo doe not delude your owne hearts, you may row up and downe in holy duties, and goe from ſinne to dutie, and from duty to ſinne, and never come to Chriſt, faith reſts upon Chriſt, and not upon duties; we muſt not neglect duties, but we muſt not reſt in them. Thus you ſee where this man fals ſhort of ſaving faith: now to ſet it home a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, you ſee there are but few that have ſaving faith, if the ignorant man went out at one doore, and the carnall Goſpeller at the other, and the meere civill man at the other, and all the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites were put into a corner, where would there be any faith found upon the face of the earth? how few have faith? and how difficult is it to get faith? the Lord convince your judgements of it; you ſee how farre men goe, and yet never have one graine of ſaving faith: what remaines then? there are two things evident from hence:</p>
               <p>Firſt, you that are gracious, and are the Saints
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:4394:261"/> of God, and ſee the baſeneſſe of the hearts of wicked men, goe your wayes home and fall to praying; Oh that wee could leave preaching and hearing a little, and all of us fall to praying, and to examination; brethren, let us leave preaching and hearing, and all of us fall to mourning, that there are ſo few beleevers: you maſters, goe your wayes home and mourne, that ſo many live in your families, and yet ſo few have gotten good by the ordinances of God; you that travell up and downe, mourne in ſecret, and ſay, Here is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man buſie in the world, one makes haſte this way, another that way; ſo many chapmen and clothiers going up and downe every weeke, and yet how few goe home to Chriſt by faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy from him? in truth I condemne my owne ſoule, becauſe I have not a heart to mourne for them; we reprove their ſinnes, and condemne them for their ſinne, and wee muſt doe ſo; but where are the heart bloud petitions that wee put up for them? and where are the teares that wee make for the ſlaine of our people? if they will needs goe to hell, let us bury them with bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and not only ſhould we doe this, but alſo you tender hearted mothers, and you that live one with another; you tender hearted wives, you have husbands, and you prize them, and love them, and ſome good you have from them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this when you ſee your husbands take lewd courſes, let your hearts breake over them, and ſay, Oh woe is mee for that poore husband of mine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that beleeveth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:4394:262"/> already;</hi> hee is caſt in heaven and in earth, both by law and Goſpell, there is no releefe for him: can you ſit by a condemned husband, and eat and drinke, and lye by a condemned husband, and never mourne for him? haply you follow him from one taphouſe to another, and ſtill a condemned man: doe you love your husbands? if they were poore, you would mourne for them, if they were dead, you would mourne for them, and ſay, alas, I am left a poore widow! but he is a condemned husband, and hath not a dram of faith, and yet you cannot mourne for him: mee thinkes the ſight of this ſhould make you ſinke againe, but alas our hearts are flinty, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mourne: and the like I may ſay of you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there are many of you, whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven children, beautifull, obedient, and wiſe, Oh mourne for them that ſo many come into the world, and ſo few come home to Chriſt by faith, the Lord be mercifull to us in this laſt age of the world, wee meerly ſcramble for our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and regard not our ſalvation, therefore get you home and mourne for them, and ſay, Oh theſe poore children which I have brought up, and had much comfort from, they are poore condemned children! this were enough to ſinke us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it ſhould bee a ground to make us ſearch into our ſelves, and thinke that the ſtaffe ſtands at our doore, imagine the hand-writing comes upon every man, then let every man take his portion, and ſay, No faith, no Chriſt, and ſo conſequently no ſalvation by Chriſt; looke to

It may be, ſaith one, I have it as well as another, but how doe you prove it? and how will you doe if you have it not? no ignorant perſon, no carnall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller, none of all theſe hath faith; what ſo many men that have ſo much knowledge, and yet fall ſhort of faith and ſalvation? Lord, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of mee? is there any faith here? make it good then, or elſe yeeld the day, and confeſſe, that there is no faith, and then there is ſome hope, ſay, I am a thouſand miles off from faith, I never knew what it was to be thus inlightened, and to bee wounded for ſinne, I can commit ſinne, and play with ſinne, but I never knew what it was to be wounded for ſinne, I never knew what it was to be zealous in a good courſe, there are many ſtrict truths that I have not a heart to receive, I confeſſe, I have no faith; now if you yeeld this, then there is ſome hope that you may get out; therefore take this advice, goe to ſome faithfull, humble, experienced Chriſtian, and to ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter, and intreat them to adviſe you how to get faith, but doe not goe to a faithleſſe heart,

               <p n="1">1 What theſe be that hinder a man from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, and here in the generall know thus much; they are very many, and very dangerous: it is therefore a point of wiſedome to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to foreſee theſe hindrances, and to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prevent theſe: Satan above all doth labour to hinder a poore ſoule this way, hee would not have a man chaſte, hee would not have a man regenerate, he would not have a man meeke and humble, but above all, hee would not have him beleeve, for then he knowes he is gone: If he bee ſo violent to caſt hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our way, wee ſhould bee as watchfull and carefull to avoid theſe hindrances. It is that wee ſhall obſerve concerning <hi>Peter; Satan,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:4394:266"/> 
                  <hi>deſires to winnow thee:</hi> Now that Chriſt aimed at, was that he would <hi>winnow his faith,</hi> and Chriſt laboured to fortifie that, for ſaith he, <hi>I have prayed that thy faith faile not;</hi> as if he had ſaid, if faith holds, all holds: the Devill ſights neither againſt ſmall nor great, but onely againſt faith; he deales with faith, as one enemy doth with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the field in fight one againſt another; if the enemy perceive that there is ſome caſtle, or ſome trench, to which the contrary ſide have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort upon all occaſions, all their aiming is to cut off their paſſage &amp; the bridge, that they may not come to the ſhelter, and then they can conquer them, and prevaile againſt them as they liſt. This is an ordinary care that one enemy hath againſt another: So Satan deales with the ſoule, hee eaſily perceives that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his promiſes, are the caſtle of a diſtreſſed ſoule; they are the trenches wherein the ſoule may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it ſelfe, and finde ſuccour upon all occaſions. Now Satan labours to cut off the paſſage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and take away the bridge of beleefe, when hee hinders a man from reſting and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt, he cuts him from comming to his ſhelter and caſtle, therefore he can prevaile againſt him as hee pleaſe. Therefore let the ſoule bee ſo much the more wary to prevent theſe hindrances, becauſe Satan is ſo carefull and watchfull to lay hindrances in the way, and to fortifie all ſides that we may not beleeve in Chriſt; this is the greateſt labour of Satan, to hinder us, let it bee our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt endevour to attaine it.</p>
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:4394:266"/>
               <p>Now to deale more plainly, the hindrances that Satan caſts in our way to keep us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, are of two ſorts. The firſt are thoſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances that doe diſinable a man from comming to Chriſt, as having no title to him, no intereſt in his mercy: ſome hindrances doe really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a man, that he cannot rely upon, and repaire unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Other there bee againe, that doe not take away our intereſt in the promiſes; they doe not hinder our title we have to Chriſt, but wee hinder our ſelves from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt, becauſe wee are not wiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe hindrances as wee ſhould, and avoid them as we ought.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee will beginne with the former, and the queſtion is, what are thoſe reall hindrances that keepe the ſoule that it cannot beleeve in the Lord Ieſus, that it never ſhall beleeve in the Lord Ieſus, upon theſe termes in that eſtate and condition, thoſe hindrances are eſpecially foure: The firſt is this: A blinded careleſſe and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſecurity and preſumption, which commonly takes poſſeſſion of the hearts of men, whereby they content themſelves with their condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the miſery of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Marke what I ſay, this ſame ſluggiſh ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, this ſame careleſſe preſumption of a mans welfare, when there is no ſuch matter, he is only blinded and deluded. When men cry peace, peace, to their ſoules, when they conclude their eſtates are good, they deſire to be no better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee no other, becauſe they ſee not the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:4394:267"/> miſery of it. Theſe cannot ſee the excellency of faith, therefore cannot make a ſtep to goe to Chriſt by faith; ſuch a ſoule is rivetted and ſcrued to his baſe wretched condition: therefore there is no trading with him in matters of faith, till his conſcience be a wakened, and his ſinnes diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The text ſaith, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and therefore will not ſeeke him; nay, he will not receive him when he comes, he cares not for him; while we thinke our ſelves whole, and ſafe, and ſound, and ſeared, and ſpeake peace to our ſoules in our naturall condition; wee looke not after Chriſt, neither will wee receive Chriſt, if hee come to our doores. It is a fine paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and it is the ground hee makes of the unbeleefe of the Iewes: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. the text ſaith, <hi>Hardneſſe is come upon the Iewes, till the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles is come in:</hi> the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is prettie.</p>
               <p>There is a kinde of ſleepy, ſluggiſh, ſtupid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed ſenſeleſneſſe in the Jew, till the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles came in; the one are hindred from comming to Chriſt, and beleeving in him, becauſe they are rocked aſleepe: therefore the word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſignifies a ſtilneſſe: for when a man hath got a ſtupid benummed heart, he is all ſtilled, all quiet and at reſt; he ſeeth nothing, he lookes after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he cares for nothing, but reſts in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he is in: and in this the Jewes ſhall dwell, till the Lord awakes him out of this ſecuritie. This is the cauſe men complaine, they cannot endure ſharp preaching, and to have their ſinnes
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:4394:267"/> diſcovered, and their conſciences awakened. I wonder Miniſters ſhould make this adoe, cannot men goe to Heaven without ſuch a ſtirre? they ſee no neede therefore they deſire no trouble: this is that the Lord obſerves of the Church of Laodicea: <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. which was an argument of the baſe eſtate ſhe was in. <hi>Thou ſaiſt thou art rich and needeſt nothing, and knowest not that thou art poore, and blinde, and miſerable, and naked, becauſe ſhe knew not her miſerie, ſhee never laboured to goe to Chriſt, to be freed from her miſery;</hi> and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Zephany</hi> 3.12. when the Lord would diſcover a people that ſhould beleeve, hee ſaith, <hi>I will leave an afflicted and a poore people, a poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſoule that trembles at Gods Word, and ſeeth his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; hee is like to looke out for ſuccour from the Lord Ieſus:</hi> nay famous is that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.39. marke a paſſage or two, they are very obſervable and uſefull for the point in hand.</p>
               <p>There our Saviour ſpeaking of the Jewes, ſaith, <hi>they could not beleeve;</hi> hee addes the reaſon, for <hi>I ſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heart of this people is waxen fat, hee hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and beleeve with their hearts, and ſhould bee converted, and I ſhould heale them:</hi> There are two paſſages obſervable, one by the by, that beleeving and converting are all one in Scripture, hee ſaith, <hi>they could not beleeve, that they might not he converted;</hi> but here was the ground why they could not beleeve: <hi>Their eyes were blinded, and their hearts were hardned.</hi> They were in a ſenſeleſſe benummed ſecure curſed
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:4394:268"/> courſe, they hope to be ſaved, and all is well, and they never ſee what condition they are in, till they are in Hell; therefore they never ſeeke out for mercy: Therefore Chriſt ſaith to the Jewes, <hi>Yee will not come to me to be ſaved, for how can yee beleeve, when yee ſeeke the honour one of another, and ſeeke not the honour that comes from God.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a man to bee in Hell and in Heaven both at once, for light and darkneſſe to bee toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, for a man to reſt upon ſinne, and upon the feee grace of Chriſt, as long as thou art ſetled, as long as thou reſteſt in thy baſe courſe, as long as thou liveſt in a naturall ſleepy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tell it to your children, you that are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; tell it to your husbands, you that are wives; husband, how can you beleeve? childe, how can you beleeve? when thou ſeekeſt not the honour of God, but ſetleſt thy ſelfe upon thy baſe rebellions, and reſteſt upon thy corruptions: Thus wee ſee the hindrance, it is a ſleepy ſecure careleſneſſe of condition.</p>
               <p>Now the cure of it is this, namely, labour to inforce thy ſelfe, touching thine owne eſtate, and pinch thine owne heart, awaken and ſtirre up thy ſoule, and pinch thine owne heart in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that miſery, and wofulneſſe of that condition thou art in, and you ſhall helpe one another. A man that is aſleepe cannot awaken himſelfe, but another man that is but new awake, that ſcarce hath his ſenſes about him, can ſtirre another better than himſelfe: bee you ſo wiſe: Every poore ſinner is aſleepe and ſecure in ſinne,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:4394:268"/> when will his eyes be open? he will never ſee, he can never awaken himſelfe; and jog him, and pinch him, awaken him you muſt, beleeve the word, you are in a fearfull condition, in a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate.</p>
               <p>A naturall man, is an accurſed man; thus deale one with another, and reſolve of this in two or three paſſages. Let every man ſay the Word is true, and reaſon undeniable, unleſſe I be altered in my condition, I ſhall bee confounded in my condition; unleſſe I be another man, I am an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed man; unleſſe I bee borne againe by the Word, it had beene better for mee I had never beene borne into the world. I muſt not thinke that Chriſt will carry my ſoule and my ſinnes to Heaven together: I muſt not perſwade my heart that fleſh and blood can enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: no heart, it will not be, you are ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and ſluggiſh, and you thinke Chriſt will ſave you; no, no, tis true Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, and tis as true Chriſt came to humble ſinners, and to ſanctifie ſinners, and to convert ſinners: Chriſt came to ſave his ſervants from ſinne, as well as from Hell: Tell thou thy owne heart thus, and never be quiet till thou affect thy ſoule with the apprehenſion of Chriſt; I am a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, and ſhall bee ſo for ever, if I continue in this condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, againe, imagine that the heart is now awakened a little, that the ſinner beginnes to ſee that hee muſt change; hee lookes about, and conceives God is angry, and his ſinnes are hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:4394:269"/> and hell is gaping for him; and the Lord tels him, there is your portion, thither you will goe one day, either you muſt be another man, or elſe an accurſed man: When the ſoule begins to thinke of this, that he muſt bee altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the other hindrance of faith is this, that a ſinner thinkes hee can change himſelfe: this is another maine hindrance, and it is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hindrances under Heaven. Firſt, the ſoule thinkes it needs no change, what ſaith the ſoule? doe you tell mee of Hell, and ſtagger my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I thinke my ſelfe well enough, but that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters will not let me alone. But now he ſeeth he muſt change, and thinkes with himſelfe, either I muſt have my ſoule humbled, and my life refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or elſe goe downe to Hell; and then hee ſhuffles for himſelfe, and ſharkes for his owne comfort, and hopes to change himſelfe, and help himſelfe out of miſery, hee conceives it is in his power, to procure his ſafety, and to ſatisfie all the wrong done to God, he now becomes a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Where is Chriſt now? he keeps the ſtaffe in his owne hand now, and hee will ſtill have it in his owne power to procure his owne happineſſe: This is that every man is naturally given to, ſince he muſt alter, he will have it in his owne power to alter himſelfe, and ſave himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This ſeemes to me to bee the meaning of the young mans ſpeech, <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. when he came to trade for life and happineſſe: <hi>What ſhall I doe, ſaith he, to gaine eternall life?</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>goe thy
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:4394:269"/> way, and keepe the Commandements: Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, thou ſhalt not ſteale, &amp;c. I have kept all theſe from my youth,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>what want I yet?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, if thou have not enough, thou ſhalt have enough before I goe; I will pay thee upon the naile, I will be aforehand with thee, I will not owe thee a farthing token: <hi>What want I yet?</hi> as though hee would not bee onely even hand, but afore hand with God; as who ſhould ſay, he could not miſſe Heaven, if he could doe as he thought he was able to doe. To have all a mans good in another, to receive all ſpiritual good from another, this is that nature is hardly brought unto, and yet this muſt be done, if ever we beleeve.</p>
               <p>To make the matter plaine otu of Scripture, this was the maine hindrance that kept the Jewes from imbracing Jeſus Chriſt: men thinke they are the braveſt Chriſtians in the world, becauſe they have this, and can doe that, becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy theſe abilities, nay performe theſe ſervices; not that a man ſhould now not doe theſe, but the reſting here, and to thinke to helpe a mans ſelfe by this meanes, and the taking up a mans reſt in theſe meanes, and the opinion of merit, this is the bane of religion, <hi>Rom.</hi>

                  </gap> 2. <hi>For I beare them record,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>that they have zeale for God, but not according to knowledge:</hi> the Iewes had a zeale for God, they loved religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they were Chriſtians, and circumciſed, and doe not theſe attaine to life and ſalvation? no, for ſaith the text, <hi>they being ignorant of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and going about to establiſh their owne
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:4394:270"/> righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt:</hi> what is the reaſon of this? becauſe they went about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Three things there be in the third verſe for our purpoſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>that a man cannot be ſaved by his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but by the righteouſneſſe of God, in and through Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that it is a point of ſubmiſſion and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> (Oh marke this) <hi>and it is a great point, it is a point of humilitie and ſubmiſſion to take and receive righteouſneſſe from another.</hi> It is a great point of ſubmiſſion, to have all from Chriſt, and nothing in our ſelves to have grace from Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from Chriſt, this is admirable.</p>
               <p>Now what hinders this ſubmiſſion? why? third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the text ſaith, <hi>They went about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe of their owne workes,</hi> as if that could doe the deed, or nothing: thou muſt count them dung in reſpect of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; that is the firſt, the whole nation of the Jewes fell ſhort of Chriſt in this point: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. marke how he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:4394:270"/> by the workes of the law.</hi> Three things againe here in the text conſider:</p>
               <p>Firſt, what ſhall we ſay? is it poſſible? what, a Gentile ſaved, and a Jew condemned? what, a Gentile that knew not God, attaine mercie, and the Jewes and people of God, caſt off from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? what ſhall wee ſay then? why? marke the text, a Gentile that never truſted to his owne righteouſneſſe, that is, a miſerable ſinfull creature he ſeeth himſelfe nothing, haply a curſed drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an adulterer, the Lord opens his eyes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his ſinnes, and makes him ſee he is a loſt man, and makes him ſee, that a Chriſt muſt ſave him from the ſinnes of his prayers, and a Chriſt muſt ſave him from the ſinnes of his performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe he is an undone man for ever: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man now, the Jew he ſought after the law, that is, they were ſtrict in the performance of the law, they had their circumciſion, their waſhing, and all ſervices, upon all occaſions curiouſly; how comes this to paſſe now, that the one is ſaved, and the other damned? becauſe the one will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Chriſt, the other will not, therefore the one hath mercie, the other hath not.</p>

               <p>Firſt, be fearfull and jealous of thy ſelfe, when through Gods aſſiſtance and helpe thou art able to get ſome power in the performance of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to get ſome meaſure of ſufficiencie, when thou haſt abilities about thee, bee moſt fearfull and jealous, becauſe then thy eſtate lieth in moſt hazard: doe in this caſe as ſea-faring men doe, they hoiſe up ſaile, and goe amaine, where there is no hazard, and where there is ſea roome enough, but if they goe in a ſtraight or in a ſand, where many have ſuffered ſhip-wrack, and there is a remembrance of it, ſuch a man periſhed here, and ſuch a man ſuffered ſhipwrack here: how carefull are they then to ſterne aright, and obſerve all curiouſly and exactly, leſt they fall where others fell before them, and ſuffer ſhipwrack where others were overthrowne: or looke as it is with men that travell, if they come to ſome ſuſpicious or theeviſh places, though they were careleſſe before, yet when they come there, leſt they be ſurpriſed on the ſudden, and to fortifie themſelves, one rides with his ſword drawne, and another with his hand upon his ſword, and they make what ſpeed they can, becauſe they ſuſpect an aſſault: ſo it is here, <hi>Saul</hi> hath ſlaine his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſands: I tell you, carnall ſecuritie hath kild many, but carnall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath ſunke downe ten hundred thouſands into hell: when you come then to this ſtand, when God hath enlightned your mindes, and given you ſome parts, and beſtowed ſome abilities upon you, and now you clap and applaud your ſelves,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:4394:273"/> and ſay, this is ſomewhat, this it is to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, poore novices muſt come and live upon my crums, and deſire my information, the Lord hath enlightned my eyes, and wrought upon my heart, thou art now upon a ſand, for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſake, take heed to thy ſelfe; here Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had like to have ſuffered ſhipwracke, and here thoſe hypocrites in <hi>Iſay</hi> 28. ſuffered ſhipwracke; here is the skull of one man, and the hand of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, and the ſoule of another man; I meane, thouſands have ſuffered ſhipwrack here: now looke to heaven, and ſuſpect thine owne ſoule, and thinke, if the Lord keepe mee now, I ſhall eſcape the worſt, but here is the moſt hazard, therefore I muſt be moſt carefull hereof: it is pretty to obſerve in experience, poore Chriſtians that are lowly and humble, how tenderly doe they walke, how fearfull are they of their hearts, of their pride, and peeviſhneſſe, and idleneſſe, and careleſneſſe; when you ſhall ſee a bold brazen fac'd, preſumptuous, carnall wretch, becauſe hee can pray, and read, and heare, he will follow rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous faſhions, and continue in baſe courſes, and carrie all away with his abilities.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I would have you conſider, is this, grow every day up in the obſervance of thine owne baſeneſſe, and in the acquaintance of thine owne weakneſſe in the beſt of thy duties; this is a ſweet pitch of a Chriſtian, the more God beſtowes, and the more grace God vouchſafes; he goeth away, and hangs downe his head, and wonders at Gods goodneſſe, that ever the Lord
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:4394:273"/> ſhould help a poore creature, ſo to call upon his Name, and ſayes, Lord it is thy grace, it came from the aſſiſtance of thy Spirit; but that ever a wretch ſhould ſay to his ſervices and duties, yee are my gods; abhorre this in thy ſoule, and keep a marvellous diſlike of thy ſelfe, and a low eſteem of thy duties, and bee wondering at Gods grace, and admiring at Gods mercy, and returne to God, that hee hath given thee power to performe any ſervice, and lie thou in the duſt, and trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine owne performances; doe therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. he ſaith, <hi>Now theſe things I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gaine, I count loſſe for Chriſt:</hi> Oh, my zeale for the Law, and the exact ſtrictneſſe of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees; I thought that would have carried mee to Heaven, but they are dung, I will tread them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfeet; nay doubtleſſe, I count all things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſervices I did before, and the prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God called me, but even ſince the beſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and performances I ever did, dung in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt.

                  </gap> to Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:4394:274"/>
               <p>The third hindrance is this, the ſinner by this time is driven from theſe two holds, and driven two ſtaires higher to Chriſt; the ſinner ſeeth he muſt change, and that he cannot helpe himſelfe, his prayers and performances are good things, good meanes, but the Phyſitian is in another place, a mans legs may carry him to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but they cannot cure him; ſo a mans ſervices are good things, but he cannot helpe himſelfe, he muſt goe to another for helpe. Another hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance is this, when the ſinner ſees hee cannot helpe himſelfe, yet he thinkes he is able to goe to another for helpe; it is a thing incident to our nature, and it is uſuall, that we thinke, that it is in our power to beleeve, and that the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon Chriſt, is not a matter of that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that hardneſſe, as ſome Miniſters pretend, and the Word ſeemes to expreſſe unto us, and this is that keepes a man utterly from going out; I beſeech you obſerve it, though a man cannot helpe himſelfe in nature, yet a man will ſay, hee can call to another for helpe, though a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuccour himſelfe in his want and neceſſitie, yet to take ſupply from another, that is an eaſie matter: ſo when we cannot doe what duties we ſhould, when wee cannot ſatisfie Gods juſtice as he requires, and anſwer the law, we thinke though we our ſelves cannot helpe our ſelves, yet wee can goe to Chriſt, and intreat him, and beſeech him to help us, and wee can receive ſuccour and help from him, this is not ſo hard a matter, this is our nature, take notice of it in experience, looke into
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:4394:274"/> the courſe of mens carriages and lives, wee ſhall obſerve, that every man will acknowledge his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in other things, but now his inabilities in this, there is not one man confeſſeth: one complaines, his abilities are poore, hee cannot pray as he ſhould; another, his parts are meane, he cannot conferre as he ought; another, his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are unruly and heady, and he cannot maſter them as God requires and commands: thus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will confeſſe his infirmities in other things, but goe to every mans doore, and aske, doe you not beleeve? why? all the ſwearers, and drunkards, and ſots in the towne, they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they can doe this, though they can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; they cannot pray, they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they cannot remember, they cannot ſubdue their corruptions, but they ſhall be taken away with company, and fall into that ſinne, but they can beleeve in Chriſt with all their hearts: thus we ſee that every man thinkes it in his power, and within the compaſſe of his abilitie naturally to reſt upon Chriſt. Now marke what followeth, why ſhould a man deſire that hee hath? why ſhould he ſeeke for that he hath attained? why ſhould he labour to be poſſeſſed of that which is in his owne power, and he is poſſeſſed of already? if I can beleeve naturally, if it be in my power to goe to Chriſt when I liſt, why ſhall I uſe all meanes, and receive abilitie to doe that which I can doe by my owne power? and this I take to be one maine ground, why the endevours of men are taken off from attending, and why the labours
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:4394:275"/> of Chriſtians are taken off from ſeeking often this bleſſed precious grace of faith: there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grounds why men are driven to this kinde of conceit, there are many reaſons that make way for this conceit:</p>
               <p>As firſt, to beleeve, is a ſpirituall thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and thy owne ſoule, to pray and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, belongs to the outward practice, but to beleeve, is a cloſure of the heart, with an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Lord and his truth, and the giving way of our ſoules thereunto: now becauſe men cannot ſee their faith, therefore no man will yeeld, but he doth beleeve.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men conceive, that it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take of mercie from Chriſt, and ſay they, is there any man that will not have mercie? is it ſuch a hard matter to receive favour offered, or to take a gift when it is tendered unto us?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe doe apprehend, that the aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Goſpell of Chriſt, wherein is revealed the riches of Gods mercie, is all that is required in faith, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>He hath ſent his Sonne into the world, that he hath prepared ſalvation in him, and wrougt redemption through him:</hi> they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and aſſent to the truth, and conceive, this is whole to beleeve; upon this ground, poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thinke it is in their power to beleeve, and take grace and helpe from Chriſt, though they cannot helpe themſelves; therefore they labour not to get grace from God to doe this worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thinke they can performe this worke by their owne abilitie and power.</p>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:4394:275"/>
               <p>The cure of this hindrance is this, and it lieth ſpecially in theſe three meditations:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſee thy ſelfe, and convince thy owne heart, how thou art cozened, and thy conſcience how thou art deceived in common ſenſe, when ſuch thoughts creepe into thy minde, and reaſon thus; were it in my power alone to beleeve, or in any mans power elſe, would any man goe to hell for want of beleeving? if it were in my power, or any mans power elſe to get faith, would any man periſh for want of faith? Take a little experience from thoſe that lie on their death beds: A rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous wretch that hath run headlong againſt the Lord and his truth, a man that hath lived ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly and ſtoutly under the means of grace, and hath taken up armes againſt God and his grace, he lieth gaſping, and then hee lookes to Heaven, and conſiders what ſhall become of him: The Miniſter ſaith he muſt renounce himſelfe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt and his promiſes to his ſoule: Oh, ſaith he, I cannot beleeve the Lord will ſave mee, and pardon me, and comfort me, I cannot reſt upon the promiſes of God: What, I ſuch a ſinner, and ſaved? what, I ſuch a ſinner and comforted? I cannot beleeve it, if all the Angels in Heaven tell it me; is it in this mans power to beleeve now when he ſees Hell open before him, and the devils ready to receive him? doe you thinke hee would ruſh into Hell, if hee could beleeve and eſcape it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, looke into the depth of thine owne heart, and weigh ſeriouſly thine owne weakneſſe
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:4394:276"/> by the ballance of the Sanctuary, and thine owne infirmities by the bleſſed Word of the Lord, and ſee that thou muſt not onely have a gift from God to take it; God muſt not onely give a man a gift, but power to receive it: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.27. <hi>No man can receive any thing, unleſſe it be given him from above;</hi> therefore judge your owne abilities, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your owne conceits, and overweening imaginations, but judge by the Word, and judge righteous judgement, that a man can receive no good thing, unleſſe God give him power. The gift muſt come from above, and the power muſt come from above, whereby hee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider and ſettle thine owne heart in this ſame determination and reſolution, that there muſt be a ſupernaturall power put forth to make thee beleeve, or elſe all the power under Heaven cannot furniſh thee with ſufficiency thereunto; a man is able to doe the condition of the firſt covenant, as to obſerve the condition of the ſecond covenant: he is as well able to keepe the Law, as to beleeve the Goſpell, unleſſe there be a power to inable him: <hi>Iames</hi> 1.18. <hi>Her hath begotten us according to his owne will, by the Word of truth;</hi> a childe cannot beget himſelfe: So it is here ſpiritually, as there naturally, the Lord doth beget us according to his owne will, it is not in our owne will to beget our ſelves, as the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians dreamed, it is not in our will to diſpoſe of our hearts, to take Chriſt when we will, to let him ſtand at doore ſo long as we ſee fit, and take
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:4394:276"/> him in when we ſee fit: but it is the Will of the Lord that muſt beget us, and not our will, that can beget our ſelves: Therefore that faith that groweth upon the ground of thy owne naturall abilitie, it is a fancy, it is no ſound faith. God muſt come down from heaven to thy ſoule, before thou canſt goe up to heaven againe; faith muſt be firſt wrought in thy ſoule, before thou canſt be carried to God by faith; there muſt bee a power in all means, above all means; there muſt be a ſpirit in all endevours above all endevours, to helpe us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or elſe wee ſhall never beleeve while the world ſtandeth: therefore avoid thoſe proud ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of heart, when men thinke they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe grace, &amp; take grace when they liſt, ſhut Chriſt out of doores over night, and take him in the morning, it is againſt ſenſe, and there is nothing more croſſe and contrary to the power of grace: No, goe ſecretly betweene God and thine owne ſoule, and confute it; what, I Lord, and my parts Lord; what, in my will Lord to beleeve, and in my power, and ſo forth: no, if all men and Angels ſhould conſpire together, and all the Miniſters under Heaven joyne together to work faith in my ſoule, it will never bee, the power of Angell, Men or Word, will never worke it, but it muſt bee the power of the Lord that muſt worke it; as we may ſee, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The ſame power that brought Chriſt out of the grave, muſt bring the ſoule to Chriſt,</hi> or elſe it will never come while the world ſtands: be perſwaded of theſe things, they are true, chuſe whether you will beleeve them;
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:4394:277"/> but the Lord make you beleeve them, that you may receive comfort to your ſoules.</p>
               <p>We come now in the ſecond place, to thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde of hinderances which doe not deprive a man of the title to Chriſt, but through our own folly and weakneſſe they ſtop us from comming ſo readily to Chriſt; wee have intereſt in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but through our owne ignorance, and Satans ſubtilty, wee goe not ſo readily to a promiſe wee have title to. The ground of all theſe hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is one, and that is this; namely when men out of carnall reaſon contrive another way to come to Chriſt than ever God ordained, than ever the Word revealed; when wee ſet up a ſtandard by Gods ſtandard, when out of the heady haughty imaginations of our mindes, wee make other termes and conditions of beleeving, than ever God made, then ever Chriſt required; we lay bars in the way, and lay boults upon our feet, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles upon our hands, and then wee complaine wee cannot goe; the fault is your owne, and the impediments are many, becauſe carnall reaſon is fruitfull to deviſe, and Satan followes, and fires, theſe imaginations. I will onely mention three hinderances which are mainly obſervable, by which many a gracious heart is wonderfully dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from comming to, and receiving benefit from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Hinderance </seg>1</label> The firſt hinderance, is a deſperate kinde of deſpaire and diſcouragement which ſometimes oppreſſeth the ſoule of a diſtreſſed ſinner; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoule lookes upon his owne corruption<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="539" facs="tcp:4394:277"/> and worthineſſe, and ſinfullneſſe, and then hee dares not come to Chriſt: hee viewes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſinnes ſo many, the nature of his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſo hainous, the continuance of them ſo long, the ſoule of a diſtreſſed man ſends his thoughts affarre off, and viewes all, both the abominations of his life, and the diſtempers of his ſoule, and ſeeth his iniquities muſtering up themſelves, and Satan helps him forward; for this is his policy; Firſt, hee will keepe a ſinner if hee can, that hee ſhall not ſee ſinne, and then all will be whole; and the ſinner thinkes there is mercy enough in a Saviour, and why ſhould I trouble my ſelfe? but when hee ſees the ſinner will pore upon his ſinnes, then hee ſhall ſee nothing elſe but ſinne, ſo that he dares not goe to God for mercy: this is that I deſire to trade in, and follow Satan as far as I can. Now the ſinner that is in this caſe, tell him that mercy is in Chriſt, and redemption offered in a Saviour, hee dares not heare of it, hee dares not thinke of it: what ſaith he, ſhall I once imagine or thinke that there is any mercy for me? that I have any title to, or intereſt in Chriſt? that were ſtrange, and the ſoule is here foyled and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon his owne miſery, and never goeth to the Phyſitian; he ſtares in the wound and never goes to a Saviour; for a man is as well kept from going to Chriſt, by poring continually upon his diſtempers by deſpaire, as by reſting upon his owne ſufficiency by preſumption; hee that ſeeth not his ſinnes, he thinkes he hath ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore will not goe to Chriſt, and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:4394:278"/> when a ſinner ſeeth and feeleth the burden of his iniquities, he dares not goe to a Saviour; this is the courſe of Satan, and here in hee is marvellous cunning: but this ſhould not be any diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our hearts from comming to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for I beſeech you obſerve it, for whom did Chriſt come into the world? for whom did Chriſt die? when he came, it was not for the righteous, that needed him not; but for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that had condemned themſelves; and hee came to ſave thoſe that could not ſave themſelves: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>It is a faihfull ſaying, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, whereof I am the chiefe: Zachary</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is a Fountaine ſet open for all people to waſh in, all ſorts of ſinnes, and all ſorts of ſinners;</hi> there is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſet open for them, bee they what they will be, be they what they can be; their ſins never ſo great, the time never ſo long, and the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe never ſo vilde, come they that will come, come and welcome. There was a fiery Serpent in the wilderneſſe, and there was a braſen Serpent to cure them that were ſtung; ſo if thou beeſt ſtung with the fiery Serpent of ſinne, Chriſt is the braſen Serpent that will heale thee. <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.24. <hi>When the Iewes had tyred God with their wickedneſſe, and wearied him with their distempers, yet the Lord for his owne Name ſake pardoned all their iniquities, and remembred their ſins no more:</hi> I ſay this, though our ſinnes bee never ſo hainous, never ſo vile and abominable in themſelves: if the ſoule can ſee theſe, and be burthened with theſe, they doe not hinder the worke of faith, and the worke of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:4394:278"/> mercy. I would faine have you thinke of that which I now ſay; it is not our ſinfulneſſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I meane our unworthineſſe, but our haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that hinders us from comming to a Saviour; it is not a mans baſeneſſe and ſinne that hinders him, but his owne haughtineſſe that lets him from comming to a Saviour; we would have ſomewhat in our ſelves, and not all from Chriſt; therefore when we have nothing in our ſelves, we are loth to goe to Chriſt: were your ſinnes leſſer, and your holineſſe greater, then you would goe; then marke what followeth; thou goeſt to Chriſt, not becauſe of the freeneſſe of his grace, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt ſomething in thy ſelfe to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee to goe to Chriſt; thou wilt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before thou wilt goe to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wilt not have all from Chriſt: therefore it is not thy baſeneſſe, and thy ſinnes that hinder thee from Chriſt, but it is thy haughtineſſe and pride.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, yet this hinders not, but at leaſt thou maiſt have a hope of mercie to ſupport thy heart in the expectation of good, and that I may ſpeake cleerely, obſerve three paſſages:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the word and meanes doe worke; if it doe make thee more ſenſible, and more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of thy owne hardneſſe and deadneſſe, though indeed it workes not that good, and after that manner thou wouldſt, and deſireſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt, yet if it make thee ſee thy owne baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and obſerve thy owne wretchedneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that body of death that hangs upon thee, it workes marvellous well, after the beſt manner, becauſe it is after Gods manner, though not after that manner which thou deſireſt, and ſeeſt beſt in thy owne apprehenſion; obſerve it, that phyſick workes moſt kindly, that makes the patient ſicke; that ſalve that drawes before it heales, cures moſt ſafely: ſo it is with the word, it workes kindly, when it makes thee ſicke of theſe diſtempers,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:4394:280"/> when it ſhewes thee the ſtubbornneſſe and deadneſſe of thy owne heart, and makes thee apprehend, that a broken ſpirit is the gift of God, and not of man and meanes; therefore the Lord will make thee looke to him to worke it and continue it; therefore know that this is a worke of God; for to ſee deadneſſe is life, and to feele hardneſſe is ſoftneſſe; onely beware, that there bee not a haunt of heart and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that thy ſoule cleaves to, and pants after, and thou art loth to part withall; for then the word will harden thee, becauſe thou hardeneſt thy ſelfe, but if thou art content that the word ſhould lay open the bowels of thy heart, and diſcover what ever is amiſſe, and reveale what ever is croſſe to Gods command, and plucke away every corruption and diſtemper; then if the word reveales any hardneſſe in thee, know that the word workes comfortably, that reveales hardneſſe and baſeneſſe, and doth drive thee out of thy ſelfe to God for ſuccour.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, thou art the cauſe why thy heart is not ſoftned, thou art the fault why the word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes not, becauſe the diſtemper of thy heart hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the worke of the word, and the diſpenſation of Gods providence, and the tenor of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; when a man will ſtint the Lord, and limit the holy One of Iſrael, juſt this ſermon, and this quarter, and this ſeaſon, this hinders the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the covenant, and croſſes the worke of the covenant of grace; the Lord doth not ſtand bent to thy bow, the Lord is not at thy call, he will not
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:4394:281"/> give thee grace when thou wilt, but when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; no, it is not for us to know the times and the ſeaſons that God hath appointed; what if thou goeſt upon thy hands and knees begging of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the laſt gaſpe, and if then the Lord be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhine in a drop of goodneſſe and mercie, it is more than the Lord owes; therefore heare to day, and attend to morrow, thou knoweſt not whether God will bleſſe this ſermon, or that meanes, or the other ordinance; and doe not complaine upon the meanes, but attend Gods leiſure, and remember the Lord hath waited long for thee in the time of your rebellion, in the day of your ignorance, before you looked towards the Lord; and therefore if the Lord now make you wait for mercie and aſſurance of his love, know that the Lord deals equally, and kindly, and lovingly with you, and ſo as all ſhall be beſt for you; and know that this diſtemper of heart oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the tenor of the covenant of grace, for the Lord gives what he will, when he will, and after what manner he will; therefore ſtint not God in his giving, but wait when and what hee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, know that thou reſteſt upon thy owne duties and endevours, and goeſt not out to God that bleſſeth both the meanes and thy endevours for thy good; and that is the reaſon why thy heart is not enlarged, and grace communicated; the fault is thy owne, becauſe thou reſteſt in thy performances, and in the meanes, and goeſt not to God that would have done more than all, and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:4394:281"/> wrought more than all theſe. If I thinke and am perſwaded I have power to goe out of my ſelfe, in conceiving I have power, and ſtaying there, I ſtay in my ſelfe, when I thinke to goe out of my ſelfe; it is a ſupernaturall worke, and the ſame hand muſt bring us out of our ſelves, that muſt bring us to Chriſt, the ſame hand muſt pluck us out of our ſelves and ſinnes, that muſt bring us to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; therefore if I thinke, and through Satans deluſion conceive, that I have abilitie to goe out of my ſelfe, I repoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my owne abilitie, when I profeſly renounce my owne abilitie, I maintaine a repoſe upon my owne abilitie, when I renounce it, I ſay, I can doe nothing, and yet reſt upon that I can doe; it is a point very profitable, therefore marke what I ſay, this is ſelfe deniall in truth, when the ſoule knowes it hath nothing, and therefore is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the almightie worke of Gods Spirit, and is ſtopped, as it were, in ſo much that the ſoule of a ſinner doth not looke to expect any power, or any principle from it ſelfe; or any creature, or any dutie, the ſoule of an humble ſinner knowes he is a dead man in ſinne; hee cannot direct his owne wayes; therefore when he is brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, it is by the almightie worke of Gods Spirit, when the Lord drawes the ſoule, that it lookes not inward, it lookes not downward, it lookes not to the creature, it expects no principle from within, no power from the meanes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any dutie, when then I thinke with my ſelfe, I have power and abilitie to goe out of my
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:4394:282"/> ſelfe, then I ſay, I have a power within me to doe ſomething pleaſing to God, namely, I can denie my ſelfe, which is contrarie; for to denie a mans ſelfe, is to looke for no power, or expect any power or ſufficiencie from himſelfe, or from the creature to performe that God requires: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt liſten and looke onely to the voice of Chriſt, he that cals us from darkneſſe, muſt call us to the glorious light of himſelfe: we muſt as well liſten to the voice that muſt pluck us out of our ſelves, and expect power from Chriſt to pluck us out of our ſelves, as wee muſt expect power from Chriſt to goe unto him: the concluſion therefore is this; I would have a ſinner ſay, and thinke with himſelfe, I expect no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Lord, from my ſelfe, I intend to wait upon the Lord, that hides himſelfe from the houſe of Iſrael, and I will looke up, I will uſe all meanes, and improve all helpes I can, but I will not looke to hearing, from that to receive any thing; I will not looke to the Miniſter, from him to receive any thing; but in theſe meanes of hearing, and prayer, and in the uſe of all ordinances, I will looke up unto God that hides his face from his ſervant for the while, and will looke up to that wiſdome to be informed, that is wiſer than the wiſdome of the meanes, and I will looke up to that power to be ſtrengthened, that is ſtronger than the power of the meanes: <hi>Habak.</hi> 3.17. when he ſaw all began to faile, <hi>though the fig-tree bloſſome not, and the vine flouriſh not, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, and ſtay my ſelfe upon the God of my ſalvation;</hi>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:4394:282"/> marke this, when all meanes under heaven faile, when the figge tree bloſſomes not, when the vine flouriſheth not; when all means faile, yet there is mercy with the Lord, there is power and ſtrength and ſufficiency in the Lord, to doe my ſoule good; and ſay thou, though my ſinnes be great, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, though my heart be hard and comes not under the power of Gods ordinances, and the means of grace work not upon my ſoule, yet I will looke up to the Lord, and my eyes ſhal be towards him; my eyes ſhall not bee inward to looke upon any thing in my ſelfe, but my eyes ſhall looke upon to the Lord, and expect all from him: and thus much ſhall ſuffice for the ſecond hinderance.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer, this hinders not that thou maiſt not come unto God by beleeving, and receive good from him: therfore remember theſe 3. particulars:</p>
               <pb n="550" facs="tcp:4394:283"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thou muſt not thinke to have joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, before thou goeſt to the promiſe: but thinke to expect it when thou doeſt beleeve, when thou doeſt chew and feed upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and continueſt ſo doing: know, that joy and ſweet refreſhment, it is a fruit that comes from faith: firſt beleeve, and then have joy; doe not thinke to have joy, and then beleeve; the heart is filled with peace and joy not before beleeving, but by beleeving, and after beleeving, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious; when faith is rooted in the heart, and hath had many ſun-ſhines of Gods favour upon it, then expect thoſe admirable raviſhments, and ſweet conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the word ſpeakes of, and thou maiſt obtaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, theſe joyes, and ſenſe, and feeling, are things which may be ſeparated from faith, a man may have a good faith, and a ſtrong faith, and yet not have that comfort and ſweet refreſhment a ſinner lookes for and deſires; a man may want ſparkes, and yet want neither life nor heat; a tree may want leaves, and yet not want ſap; ſo it is with thoſe conſolations: faith may bee ſtrong, when a mans feeling may be nothing; <hi>Reſtore to mee the joy of thy ſalvation,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> hee was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſanctified, and had faith, and yet had not this joy; nay <hi>Iob</hi> had faith, and yet he had no ſenſe and feeling of Gods favour: <hi>Thou makeſt me a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Saints of God are deprived of comfort, not becauſe God will withhold it, but becauſe they will not take it; Gods owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants want the aſſurance of the freeneſſe of Gods love, not becauſe God will take it away from them, but they will not take it when hee would give it them; it is not, becauſe they may not have it, but becauſe they will not receive it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>My ſoule refuſed comfort,</hi> like a little childe that will not eat his meat, becauſe it is not in a golden diſh; he doth not ſay, God did not offer mee conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I refuſed conſolation out of a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirit: becauſe you cannot have comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your owne termes, and pleaſe your owne pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats; becauſe you cannot have a diſh for your tooth, you will have none at all; you want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, not becauſe God will not give it, but becauſe you will not take it upon Gods termes: theſe and many more are the hinderances. One ſaith, God hath followed mee with croſſes in my life and eſtate; another, the wrath of the Lord lies heavy upon me, I am ſtill doubting and perplexed, and I cannot beleeve. The upſhot of all theſe is upon one and the ſame ground, theſe are hinderances, which we out of our owne folly, and the ſubtilty of Satan, make to hinder us from comming ſo freely to Chriſt, and beleeving in him, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we might; and yet in truth theſe are no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:4394:284"/> we onely make them ſo. Therefore we will now come to the cure of all theſe, and ſhew how wee may take off theſe hinderances if it bee poſſible, as in truth it is poſſible; and not onely to remove theſe hinderances, but all other of this kinde, quality and condition, if you will attend to the means that ſhall be propounded, it is poſſible to cure them; and the cures are theſe, whereby the ſoule may bee fortified againſt theſe, or paſſe by, and leap over all theſe hinderances; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all, goe to Chriſt in the promiſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Cure. </seg>1</label> The firſt cure and helpe that I deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound is this, namely we muſt not look too long; the ſoule diſtreſſed and troubled ſhould not ſticke too long, and looke too much, and dwell unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably and continually upon the ſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his owne ſinnes, upon his weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſtempers, ſo farre as to bee skared, and altogether diſcouraged from comming to, and depending upon the riches of Gods free grace. The devill keeps us in our ſinnes by poring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon our ſinnes, when we thinke to have our hearts carried againſt our corruptions, we are more intangled in our corruptions, by dwelling continually upon them. This was the courſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> tooke, that was the Father of all the faithfull: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. when God had promiſed him a ſonne, and not onely a naturall ſonne, but a ſonne that ſhould be a Type of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he and all the faithfull ſhould be ſaved: Now this promiſe was made unto him when hee had a dead body, and <hi>Sarah</hi> a barren wombe; he unable

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, wee ſtop the ſtreame and current of the promiſe, that it cannot run into the ſoule, wee
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:4394:285"/> turne the frame of the ſoule downward, and the frame of the heart inward, &amp; ſhut down the ſluce, whereas by beleeving wee open the flood-gates of the promiſe, that the ſtreames of mercy may flow a main in upon our ſoules, when we returne inward, and doe ſettle our hearts upon our owne diſtempers, we ſhut downe the ſluce of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly ſet open the flood and ſtream of corruptions, that they may run violently upon us to the overwhelming of us in concluſion; and our diſtempers will take advantages againſt us, by reaſon of our dayly conſideration and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereupon. Meditation in this caſe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to diſtillation; when a woman diſtils a kind of herbe or flower, and when the Alchymiſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils ſome kinde of metall, there is an admirable water drawne out by diſtillation, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oyle by Alchymie, and this water and oyle were in the creatures before, but they were not ſeene to be there before, but they are of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full force and ſtrength when they are diſtilled: ſo it is with the dayly poring, ſetling and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon a mans diſtempers; a man thereby diſtils a diſtemper and a diſcouragement, and an infirmitie, and drawes out the very life and ſap, and ſpirit of it, and drawes out the very quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a corruption, and makes it dangerous, nay he makes it deadly many times; ſo that after a mans dayly poring upon, and attending wholly to his ſinnes, he multiplies inconveniencies more than elſe would be: ſo that the ſoule which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was troubled comes now to bee overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:4394:285"/> with the dayly poring, and looking, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to his owne wickedneſſe. Therefore the wiſedome of the woman of Canaan is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and her humiliation is to bee regarded by us: obſerve the humiliation of her heart, and the wiſedome of her minde: <hi>Matthew</hi> 15.27. <hi>ſhe came to him to beſeech him to heale her daughter, that was poſſeſſed with a devill:</hi> at the firſt, hee would not liſten unto her, but ſhee would not be put off ſo, but cried after him; then hee anſwered, <hi>I am not ſent but to the lost ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael, not to you that are Gentiles:</hi> yet for all this ſhee would not leave him, but came and fell downe, and worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, helpe me:</hi> then at laſt he compares her to a dog, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and caſt it unto dogs;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, you Gentiles are dogs, and the glad tidings of the Goſpell are bread, and therefore belong not unto you: Now had ſhee pored and ſetled her ſelfe upon the words of our Saviour, ſhe had never beene made partaker of that mercy which Chriſt beſtowed, and ſhe ſtood in need of: now marke what ſhee ſaith, <hi>Truth Lord, but the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their Masters table.</hi> Here obſerve a heart truly humbled, and alſo truly wiſe to apprehend its owne weakneſſe; ſhe confeſſed all that Chriſt ſpake.

Enter not, I ſay, into the liſts of diſpute with Satan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things which belong not unto you: as for example, If I bee elected, then I ſhall bee ſaved; but I am not elected, I have injoyed Gods ordinances, and lived under the precious means of grace and ſalvation, and they have not wrought upon my heart; I perceive that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to doe no good unto my ſoule, therefore all my labor is in vain, when I have done what I can, I ſhall periſh. Sometimes againe the ſoule ſaith, the day is paſt, and the time is gone: Oh, the times of grace, and dayes of mercy that I have ſeene, the Lord came kindly to my ſoule, and was pleaſed gratiouſly to reveale my ſinnes to my ſoule: but then hard hearted I, and ſtubborne wretch I, I ſhut the doore againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and now mercy is gone, the day is over, the time is paſt, and the ſunne is ſet, there is now no hope of mercy. If the devill catch a man upon theſe liſts, there is no determination of the point, for upon this ground a man ſhall never gaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to himſelfe, hee ſhall never gaine eaſe to his

It is in this caſe with a ſinner, as it is with a traveller; theeves overtake him, and pretend to lead him a faire way, at laſt they carry him into a wilderneſſe, and lead him into a deſert where no man comes by, where no mans voyce can bee heard, and there they doe what they liſt, becauſe there is no helpe to bee expected, no paſſenger comes neere: So it is with the ſoule, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gets him into theſe ſtraits, and wilders him in the deſarts of Gods ſecret counſels of election and the like, there is no paſſenger comes by this way, no man can apprehend theſe ſecret things of Gods counſell, and therefore no man can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſuccour or comfort: therefore for your caution and direction in this caſe, I will ſuggeſt theſe three rules.</p>

The want of this is the cauſe why new ſuits are made and new bills put up againſt the ſoule, the want of ſatisfying conſcience, as experience teacheth us in caſes of conſcience: take a poore ſinner that

<pb n="595" facs="tcp:4394:307"/> mine enemies;</hi> but what is the reaſon of it? they are ever with me; ſo Satan is wiſe, and carnall reaſon, and the world, and temptations are ſubtill; but bleſſed be our God, that makes every poore ignorant creature, that beleeves in him, and reſts upon him, wiſer than all his enemies, wiſer than the cunning ſerpent, wiſer than the ſubtill pleas of carnall reaſon, wiſer than the cunning of all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: let the Word be continually with you, from day to day, and that will make you diſcover all the ſleights and ſtratagems, and all the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tricks of Satan, and not only ſhew you what is amiſſe, but thereby you ſhall get ground to your ſoules, to anſwer all Satans pleas: Satan deales with the ſoule of a proud ſinner in this caſe, as enemies in the warre; as <hi>Ioſuah</hi> 8. you know when <hi>Ioſuah</hi> went to defeat the men of Ai, hee towled them out of the Citie, his armie fled before them as formerly, and they all fallied out of the Citie upon them, and when he had them out of the Citie, the men in ambuſh circumvented them, and then they that fled, turned back upon them before, and the reſt burnt the Citie; had the men of Ai kept within the Citie, it is true, God could have overthrowne it, but yet they might have put it to the venture, they might have tried it out; but when they had left the Citie, there was no hope: ſo Satan deales with the ſoule, our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle or trenches are the promiſes of God, Gods Word and ordinances, eſpecially the promiſes, are the trenches, whereby the ſoules of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are fortified; now if Satan can but get you
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:4394:308"/> out of your trenches, and towle you out of your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he hath what he would have; if you will liſten to every carnall reaſon, and to every temptation, and talke and parly with it, then Satan hath you in ambuſh, and will ſurpriſe you; if he can make you loſe ground in the promiſe, he damps your ſpirits, and will intangle you in temptations, and hinder the comfort of your ſoules; the advice I give you in this caſe, is that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.28. <hi>Little children, if yee abide in Gods commandements, yee abide in God;</hi> if we abide in Gods counſels, and ordinances, and promiſes, wee abide in him: he ſpeaks to the weake, as if hee had ſaid, you are weake and feeble, I know the blindneſſe of your mindes, how unable you are to foreſee temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and weake and unable to beare temptations, and I know, that <hi>Satan goes about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom hee may devoure;</hi> and you are little lambs, weake, and feeble, and unable to withſtand him: but little children abide in God, keep home, keep home, and then you are ſure to be ſafe. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever dangers are abroad, or any danger in the ſtreets, we keepe the doore ſhut, to keepe little ones within, that they may catch no harme abroad; and if they get out, and get a knock, and come crying, we ſay, why did you not keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then, who bade you goe out then? ſo you that are little ones in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all the armies of hell are combining againſt you, keepe within your trenches, dwell in God, and abide in him; you will goe out now and then, and tamper with carnall reaſons, and
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:4394:308"/> Satans cavill, and come home with a broken heart, and troubled ſpirit, and comfort is gone, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is gone, and all is gone; keepe home then I charge you, what have you to doe abroad? therefore intrench your ſelves in the promiſes of God, and keepe your ſelves within the Caſtle of Gods Ordinances and Commandements, and then be ſafe and ſure. The iſſue then is this, judge thy ſoule by the Word, and looke upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere part, and doe not take thy ſoule on the worſt hand, and what thou ſo judgeſt to be in, labour to convince thy conſcience thereof, and to have conſcience ſpeake for thee: what reaſon is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and conſcience convinced of, labour to make thy heart ſubject, and ſubmit and yeeld thereunto without any gain-ſaying; what reaſon allowes, and conſcience witneſſeth, let thy ſoule enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and not a word more; and what thy heart ſubmits unto, hold to that and maintaine it for ever, and never let it goe: this is the meanes whereby a ſoule diſtreſſed may repaire to God in the uſe of Gods ordinances, and may receive joy and eſtabliſhed comfort to thy dying day, and may goe ſinging to thy grave; let Satan tempt, let the world allure, let corruption ſtirre, and the heart quarrell, keepe within doores, keepe within your trenches, and remaine ſafe from danger. Looke as it is with a man that hath his houſe well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his foundations firmly built, when the windes blow, and the ſtormes beat upon his houſe, hee ſleeps moſt quietly, becauſe hee is in a houſe where he is ſafe, and free from danger; the
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:4394:309"/> windes blow not in him, the water pierces not through; you that have title to Chriſt and grace, and to the promiſes, they are they that will keep you, and defend you againſt winde and weather; though the windes roare from Eaſt to Weſt, though the ſtormes beat, though Satan be never ſo ſubtill, and corruptions never ſo violent; nay though hell gates were open, and all the devils in hell rored upon thy ſoule, and all the fierceneſſe of temptations aſſault you from day to day, lie cloſe and bring your hearts to faſten to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, keepe within doores, keep within your caſtles: ſit ſtill and repoſe your ſoules upon the promiſes of God, and upon the riches of Gods free grace, and you ſhall ſee that the ſtorme will over, and Satan will bee defeated: and you ſhall have comfort, and you may goe ſinging to your graves, though you have many weakneſſes and failings, and diſtempers: yet ſtay here, and nothing can doe you harme.</p>
               <p>Now wee come to the means, that here may uſefully be conſidered for the bringing on of the heart to beleeve: but you will ſay, what bee the means that a man may uſe through Gods bleſſing and grace, to attaine this grace of faith, and the uſe thereof; for this is certaine wee muſt uſe the means, but there is no means under Heaven, alone will doe it; yet you muſt wait upon God in the uſe of the means: for it is not the meanes alone, that will worke faith, but the Spirit of God in the uſe of the means; and therefore the text ſaith, <hi>to you it is given to beleeve;</hi> for faith is the free
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:4394:309"/> gift of God, it is God that muſt doe it, and yet he will not doe it without us, becauſe we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men and women, the Lord affords us means, and therefore we are to wait upon him in the uſe of thoſe means, let the Lord doe what he will, and let us doe what wee ſhould, uſe the means which God hath appointed: and thoſe are theſe foure.</p>

Now therefore when all our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hopes are taken away, wee muſt needs ſtay upon the promiſe, becauſe we have nothing elſe; yet I ſay, it is not requiſite that a man ſhould caſt away thoſe outward comforts that God affords him, but take them when God gives them, but onely this, that though you have all, yet labour

Now when the ſoule ſeeth theſe things cannot ſuccour him but lay him in the duſt, then he will be content to have his heart ſevered from them. It is with the ſoule as it was with <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove; <hi>When the Arke began to reſt upon the mountaine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raret, Noah ſent out the Dove, but the Dove found no reſt for the ſole of her foot:</hi> no queſtion there were many dead darkaſſes, <hi>but the Dove found no reſt till ſhee came to the Arke againe:</hi> So when a man findes no reſt in any thing the creature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, and can get no footing for the ſoule to to ſtay it ſelfe upon them, then it betakes it ſelfe to Chriſt, and goes home to the promiſe, and reſts there, and expects from thence what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as in the Art of ſwimming, hee that will ſwimme, muſt plucke his feet from the bottome, and commit himſelfe to the ſtreame to beare him up, ſo we muſt plucke our hearts from theſe things here below, and them from us; and though wee have honour and preferments, yet wee muſt not put any confidence in them, but learne by our beleeving to commit our ſelves wholly to the power of the promiſe, and receive comfort from thence onely: as <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> ſaid ſinfully; <hi>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad, &amp;c.</hi> Rely not upon them, for the gods cannot helpe you: ſo ſhould wee reaſon, when wee finde our hearts

To ſumme up the point briefly thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, when wee have pluckt away all carnall props, there is way made for the promiſe to come to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when our hearts are poſſeſſed thorowly of the ſufficiencie of Gods promiſe and grace, then the promiſe drawes neere to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when we expect all from the promiſe, even power to come to the promiſe, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe layes hold upon us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when we are content to yeeld to the equall conditions of the promiſe, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe carries us quite away.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeene the hinderances removed, and the meanes propounded, and now that wee may be moved and perſwaded importunately to
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:4394:315"/> ſeeke after this bleſſed grace of God: Ile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound three motives:</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>1</label> The firſt motive is this: becauſe if you once get this grace, you get all other graces with it; in this you have all the reſt attending, and you have all the reſt overplus: it is a ground of comfort to ſet a man aworke, when in the doing of one, he may doe many things; ſo it is in the worke of faith: men that are wiſe to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to lay out their money for their beſt advantage; for a purchaſe, if they ſee it is well wooded, and all the ſtocke goes into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; eſpecially if there be ſome golden mynes, all their mindes will be upon that purchaſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they have that, they have all in that: ſo it is here, get this grace, and get all; ſtrengthen this, and ſtrengthen all; nouriſh this, and nouriſh all; want this, and want all: once get this, and then you need not ſeeke for wiſdome, for faith will make you wiſe, it will bring holineſſe with it to purge you: Ah the golden mynes of mercy and ſalvation, doe all attend upon the purchaſe of faith: it is in this caſe with faith, as it is in a mans body, a man hath an eſpeciall care of his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and liver, becauſe the ſtomack diſgeſts his meat, and the liver makes bloud, and bloud is in all; and now if all be maintained, all is for health: ſo, what ever a man lookes to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="611" facs="tcp:4394:315"/> get all: 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Wee all with open face behold, as in a glaſſe, the glorie of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame image from glorie to glorie;</hi> I have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place before, to have the glorious grace of God, his me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, as all grace comes by faith, for it is faith that cloſeth with Chriſt, and from Chriſt receiveth grace for grace; as the ſeale leaves the ſame impreſſion upon the wax, that is upon it ſelfe, ſo ſecondly by faith wee are delivered from all, and made conquerours over all: either ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that can aſſault us, or miſeries that can trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us: wee have many enemies, the Devill and the world, but eſpecially a vile, baſe, and corrupt heart, if you know and feele theſe miſeries; here is one ſpeciall privilege of faith, it will rid all theſe, and make you conquerours over all theſe enemies; this only faith can doe: every man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for maſtery and victory; this is the white that every man ſhoots at, as it is in a pitched field, though it be but for one victory, how every ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="615" facs="tcp:4394:317"/> it was not mixt with faith in thoſe that heard it:</hi> hadſt thou the greateſt parts and abilities under heaven, if thou hadſt not faith with them, they would not profit thee; men thinke to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all with their power, wit, and policie, but I ſay, All will not profit them without faith; if thou canſt receive the Sacraments with faith, it will ſtrengthen thee; if thou canſt heare the Word with faith, the terrours of the law will humble thee, and the commands thereof will direct thee, and awe thee, but otherwiſe all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though an Angell ſhould come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and preach to you: as it is with the meanes of the body, if a man eat never ſo much meat, and cannot digeſt it, if the ſtomack bee clogged with it, there is nothing but ſickneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes come from it, but if a man take but a little meat, and digeſt it well, it will nouriſh him, and doe him much good: ſo it is here, that which is the ſtomack and liver of the ſoule, is faith, and that turnes the Word, and Sacraments, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances into good bloud; it is a lowly beleeving heart, that gets good by this.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, all our performances finde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance through faith; the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> and I ſay, That without faith it is impoſſible that thou ſhouldſt pleaſe God, though thy judgement is weake, and thy parts humble, and thy ability poore and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but yet if thou canſt but ſigh up to heaven by faith, that ſigh is accepted in heaven with faith, all thy weakneſſes are pardoned, and all

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This is that which turneth all our ſinnes and curſes into good to us: (Oh marke that) not that it makes them good in themſelves, but it brings good out of them. The cunning Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and wiſe Phyſitian can make the moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon, the moſt ſoveraigne cordiall, becauſe he corrects the one, that is ſo many degrees could, and puts a ſtronger ſpirit of heat into foure of five degrees of it, and ſo fits it to be marvellous cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; ſo faith makes a ſweet extract out of pride, and the venome of ſinne and corruption, without this is, the overpowring worke of faith, at <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14. <hi>For this I know that by the ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt, this ſhall turne to my good and ſalvation through your prayers.</hi>

               <p>To winde up the point, let us conſider all theſe motives, and conſider whether wee can move our hearts to labour for this grace; would you not be glorious in all the graces of God, as humility, meekneſſe and patience, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all your enemies, and the baſeneſſe of your owne hearts, and would you not have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon what you enjoy, and would you not have all worke for your good, if theſe bee worth

As <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give mee children, or elſe I die,</hi> ſo ſay thou, Lord give mee faith, or elſe I periſh: Lord I know all my labour cannot worke faith, and all meanes under Heaven cannot give it, but it is thou, Lord, that muſt doe it, and as the text ſaith, <hi>Many beleeved through grace:</hi> Lord therefore through that grace of thine, draw this heart to thee, and keepe it with thee, and make thy poore ſervant bleſſed for ever. Thus much for the uſe of exhortation, namely, that we ſhould get faith.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the ſecond part of exhortation, and here wee are to endevour if God bee pleaſed to goe out with us, to perſwade the heart of thoſe that be faithfull to live by faith: the Lord brought thy unfaithfull heart to beleeve; now then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to husband this grace well, and to improve it for thy beſt good, and live by it.

And therefore the text ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and againe I ſay rejoyce, and make your calling and election ſure: Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>God hath ſworne that by two immutable things, wherein it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, wee might have ſtrong conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> nay, the Lord rejoyceth in the proſperity of his ſervants, and therefore he hath provided mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and richly for you, that you may rejoyce; therefore wee doe the Lord and his promiſes a great deale of wrong, and bring an ill report upon that grace and mercy of his, when wee open the mouthes of the wicked, and make them ſay, Oh, theſe preciſe people talke of quiet, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, there is great talking of theſe things, but wee could never

                     </gap> to thoſe that love and feare thy Name:</hi> the fault was not in the promiſes that they could not, nor in his faith that it would not helpe him, but he let the promiſes lie by, they came into the table, but he never caſt them up, neither did hee husband then aright: hee had a world of comforts and conſolations that would have given a man liberty in priſon, and honour in ſhame and diſgrace, and comfort in the time of diſtreſſe, but hee did not husband them. Therefore be adviſed to doe as the trades-man doth, hee will not ſpend of his ſtocke, but live of his trading. So I would have every Chriſtian to make a living of his faith, whatever ſtrength thou needſt, fetch it from grace in Chriſt, and what ever comfort thou wanteſt, fetch it from Chriſt, but live by faith, and make a good living of it too, and then thou doſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the promiſe aright: bring but an empty beleeving heart with thee, and the oyle will never faile, and the meale in the barrell will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decay, but continually ſupply thee as it did that poore widow: So goe with an humble heart to the promiſes, and husband it well, and thou maiſt draw life and grace from the promiſes till doomes day. And thus in generall.</p>

This is the complaint of poore people now adayes, that they have no worke. So it is in a Chriſtian courſe, many poore Chriſtians that are newly ſet up, and are not afore-hand in the world, they want even matter for their faith: I meane ſome are ignorant and cannot read, and ſome have not meanes and a preaching Miniſter, and others have but ſmall parts and cannot heare, and little doe they retaine of what they doe heare: Now becauſe they want the promiſes of God underſtood and remembred, and rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, therefore they live marvellouſly poore, though they might live marvellouſly comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world: and now they have a word of
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:4394:321"/> comfort, and ſometimes the advice of a friend, and they have faith, but they want matter for their faith to worke upon, and therefore they are ſcarcely able to uphold their ſoules in trouble.</p>

               <p>Now that wee may provide matter for our faith, three rules are to bee obſerved, which are commonly obſerved in all proviſions:</p>

               <p>So I would have a good Chriſtian to ſtore up all the good promiſes of God, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Remember this firſt.</note> in all the good Word of God ſeaſonably; I meane when all thy parts and abilities are ſtrong, and nature is able to fight it out, &amp; while the Faire day of Gods favour laſteth, and while the Word and Sacraments are diſpenſed: this is the beſt time to lay in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, that we may not want them, when

As it is with a mariner when the ſhip is upon the ground in the ebbe and low water, hee doth not expect to tugge his ſhip to the ſhore by any power of himſelfe; it is not in my wiſedome that can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect mee, and it is not in my weapon that can defend mee; it is not this humility that can bring my ſoule downe, it is not here, it is not I Lord, that can reſt, or goe to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; even all our abillities are at an ebbe, all that we have or can doe is to empty our ſelves, and fit our ſelves, and to get up the maine maſt, that is, let the ſoule bee ready for the promiſe by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that to be carried heaven ward, and Chriſt ward; take notice of this in your owne ſoules, that the heart would begin at home; if a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come, the heart of it ſelfe would overcome it; and if a duty to be done, the heart of it ſelfe would performe it; and if oppoſition come, the heart of it ſelfe would reſiſt it: O remember that it is I a man offers an injury againſt, reaſon, ſenſe, and religion, and all. Now thy faith begins to wraſtle with him, and his dealings and conſcience checks and thou wilt teare thine owne heart out of thine owne boſome; brethren, this will not doe it. When a ſhip of a hundred tuns is upon ground, the mariners may pull and tug their hearts out before they can get it goe: O goe then and ſay, it is not I that can be patient, and put up a wrong, be quiet and expect it not from hence; let the heart

The only way for a man to thrive in his eſtate, is this, hee muſt dwell upon his owne meanes, and have it all in his owne occupying: for
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:4394:333"/> as we uſe to ſay, If a man leaſe it out, why may not he get ſomething by keeping of it, as another by hiring of it? If he would doe thus (ſay we) he muſt needs get more than hee doth now: ſo it ought to be in our ſpirituall eſtate, and ſo faith will enable us that wee may doe, not only to take the preſent benefit that the promiſe will afford in this life, but the promiſe is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeene: all that glory and happineſſe in heaven, not yet ſeene, and not yet in fruition, faith will make all that happineſſe within view, and puts us into poſſeſſion of them, and makes them have a being to our ſoules: faith it is that brings Chriſt, and makes Chriſt preſent, and in Chriſt all preſented, all glorie is in Chriſt, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it; and faith makes all that glory preſent, all happineſſe in Chriſt, who is the worker of it; and faith makes all that happineſſe to be preſent; ſo that by faith laying hold on thy Saviour, not only to take comfort, but to make all that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and good, that is eternally to be preſent; as <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>Feare not little flock;</hi> but might they not ſay, How ſhall we chuſe but feare, ſeeing there is nothing but ſinnes within that deſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and enemies without that breath forth threatnings?

<pb n="648" facs="tcp:4394:334"/> ſhall have a kingdome; remember that, and ſo you ſhall be comforted and refreſhed, live upon this: when you looke only to the preſent benefit of the promiſe (it is true) this is more than wee can conceive, yet wee let the better part of our ſtock and eſtate lye by us, for there are two parts of the promiſe, the preſent good and peace, and the eternall and everlaſting good and comfort of it; now when we looke only to the preſent good of it, this is ill husbandry, for wee let the better part of the ſtocke lye dead by us, and doe not trade with it, as it is in the world for temporall meanes, ſo it is for our ſpirituall eſtates: for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſuccour and ſupply, though a man have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for the preſent, yet if hee have ſome old rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to come, this beares up his heart in the time of poverty and miſery; and he ſaith, if he can but make a ſcrambling ſhift for ſo long time, then hee hopes to live as well as any man in the Country. So that there is not ſome of the promiſe that we have in poſſeſſion, but there is the reverſion of old rents, as old rents of farmes, that were let long agoe, when the leaſes come out, they are worth treble the rent they were let at the firſt: So there are the old rents of comfort and mercie, as, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you:</hi> then no more teares, no more trouble, no more ſorrow, no more ſinne, get thoſe into your hands, and have them in uſe, and ſay, The day will come, when wee ſhall have happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bliſſe and joy, beyond all that the tongue of man can expreſſe, or the heart of man conceive,
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:4394:334"/> though we are buffeted with many temptations, and wearied with a world of corruptions, yet we ſhall bee ſaved, ſaith faith. Thus a man may make a pretty good ſhift to live upon theſe termes, though we have nothing elſe to live upon in the world: therefore remember what now I ſpeake, Labour to faſten this truth upon thy heart, that there is not onely preſent good in thy ſelfe, but in another, and reſerved by another for thy comfort; and be thou content that it ſhould be ſo, not only to looke what thou haſt, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the greateſt part of thy glory, is in the glory of a Chriſt, and the greateſt part of thy wiſdome, is in the wiſdome of a Chriſt; and thy liberty, in the liberty of a Chriſt; and thy riches, in the riches of a Chriſt; and know, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Chriſt, thou haſt it all as thine: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.12. <hi>Behold what love the Father hath ſhewed to us, that we are now the Sonnes of God;</hi> I tell you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this is a marvellous privilege, and if you had no more but this, you had a childes portion: but it appeares not what we ſhall have, we have but a glimſe now, what will the harveſt be? and now we have only ſome ſips of it, what ſhall then the full cup be, when we ſhall ſee Chriſt as he is? thus <hi>Moſes</hi> did improve his eſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. he bare all afflictions comfortably, yea, he eſteemed the rebukes of Chriſt greater riches than the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Egypt; why? becauſe he had an eye to the recompence of the reward; we account of a mans eſtate, for what he hath for preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but what is like to befall him, and what hee

As for inſtance, I am in perſecution, and either I would have deliverance and ſafety that I might not be impriſoned, or elſe comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Lord carry me thither; therefore I would ſee all this in the promiſe, ſtill reſerving the conditions before mentioned: If thou art in priſon, eye liberty, and preſervation in Chriſt, he that is the great deliverer of his people, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his people in his hands, and then ſet Gods power and faithfulneſſe aworke that can doe it, and his wiſedome that can contrive it for thy good, that which thou ſeeſt and needeſt in the promiſe, that the power &amp; wiſedome of God may comunicate to thy ſoule: this is the meaning of that place, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy wayes unto the Lord, truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe;</hi> root thy ſelfe, and lay all thy weight of all thy occaſions upon the Lord. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Hurle your care upon the Lord, for hee careth for you.</hi> It is Gods proper office and worke, He careth for thy ſoule, therefore lay it all upon him, and put over all thy care into his hands, and
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:4394:339"/> ſet his power and faithfulneſſe a worke; only this is here a little to be ſcanned. I ſpeake not this, that we ſhould take no care at all; but I ſay, hang all thy weight and burthen of thy care upon the Lord. The Brewer he tumbles the barrell of beere and roules it, but the earth that bears it; ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever trouble is in thy eare, roule it upon the Lord: That is thus, the weight of a mans occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, lies eſpecially in three things, which a man muſt hurle off himſelfe, and lay upon the Lord: either a man ſhall not bee able to know what hee ſhall doe, or what hee is commanded, or elſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſhall not be able to doe what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and he knowes; or elſe thirdly, he ſhall not finde ſucceſſe in what he doth. It is not a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe what we can, or to imploy our ſelves as we are able, but this is the trouble, when the heart ſaith, I ſhall not know what Gods minde is, or I ſhall not doe what I know, or it will not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, or no it is not in my power. Now we leave all theſe with God, and meddle not with them, but put them over to the Lord, and meddle with thy owne duty and worke, and let God alone with his; and ſay thou unto the Lord, In truth Lord it is not in my power, it is not in my parts or worke either to compaſſe that wiſedome that is able to direct my ſelfe, or to have any power to doe all that is commanded, much leſſe to give good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; Lord, I will not meddle with that, but leave it to thy Majeſtie; if thou in thy power canſt not, nor in thy faithfulneſſe and goodneſſe careſt not for thy poore helpleſſe creature, then I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and if thou wilt not be faithfull, then I am
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:4394:339"/> content to bee miſerable, and ſo thou maiſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man that hath promiſed to undertake ſome buſineſſe for a friend, and then in the end it proves ſomewhat troubleſome, and therefore he wiſheth his friend to take it againe into his owne hands, for it is very troubleſome: but a man will leave it unto him and ſay, he hath ingaged himſelfe to doe it, and hee will not looke after it, I will not meddle with it any more: ſo what end it is that is in Gods royall prerogative, leave it with God, and doe not meddle with it; let God looke to it, leave it to Gods faithfulneſſe and power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it.

Thou wouldſt have God bleſſe thee in thy eſtate, and yet thou wouldſt bee idle and careleſſe: but this will not doe the deed; God would give thee a bleſſing, but thou art not there to take it; this is the excellency of the promiſes of God, as they require conditions before they beſtow mercies, ſo they make us able to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the conditions, and give the conditions
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:4394:340"/> as for example, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. The Lord in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Chapter promiſeth to give many things to them, but how? It muſt bee by prayer, and humbling themſelves before him, hee will give a bleſſing in thy family by prayer in it, and a bleſſing in private, by praying in private, and ſtrength againſt ſinne, and power againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but I will bee ſought unto for all theſe, ſaith the Lord, and the text ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh in his integritie, and his children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him;</hi> therefore walke thou in the integrity, that is the condition of a Chriſtian in generall, or as a husband, or as a wife, or as a ſervant in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, this the promiſe requires: but marke this now, the ſame promiſe that requires the condition, will help us to performe the conditions, and the ſame Lord that ſaith, <hi>I will bee intreated and ſought to, for all theſe,</hi> the ſame Lord ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Hee prepareth their hearts to pray;</hi> goe thou therefore to God, to help thee to pray, that he may beſtow his bleſſing upon thee, which he hath promiſed: <hi>Ezech.</hi> 26.27. <hi>He will firſt give them a new heart, and then teach them to walke in his wayes;</hi> ſo if thou wilt walk in Gods wayes, thou ſhalt have his bleſſings: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go thou by the power of faith to the promiſe of God for ſtrength and grace, and that thou muſt uſe the means appointed, and then expect a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from it in the courſe of his providence: now is Gods power and faithfulneſſe ſet a worke.</p>

                  <pb n="662" facs="tcp:4394:341"/> 3.33. There by leaning, is called ſealing to the promiſe: this is the nature of ſealing, when a man hath drawen the articles of agreement, and when they have ſealed, all is done: ſo faith muſt make the promiſe authenticall, and put a ſeale to it, that is true, and ſaith, it is done in heaven, and I am fully reſolved, and ſetledly perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that I ſhall have whatſoever I have beleeved, and thou haſt promiſed, and I have uſed meanes, for in the way of thy providence, famous is that of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.5. the Lord had bidden him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his ſonne, and yet hee ſaid, that hee ſhould live: and therefore when hee came to the place, he ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Abide you herewith the aſſes, for I and the childe will goe yonder and ſacrifice, and will come againe to you;</hi> he thought to ſacrifice him, and yet by faith he beleeved, that he ſhould bring <hi>Iſaac</hi> againe. So I would have a poore Saint of God to conclude, when thou findeſt thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts like <hi>Iſaacks,</hi> in the aſhes, and thy eſtate hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and helpleſſe; yet even then ſet Gods power on worke, and wait upon him in the uſe of the meanes, that hee hath appointed, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, and bring patience, power, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo in every kinde, according to all thy neceſſities: yet remember this, expect no more from the promiſe, than God will give in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but ſay, my ſinnes ſhall bee maſtered one day, and theſe temptations ſhall be one day over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, that have ſo long annoyed the ſoule of thy poore ſervant, I have begged ſuccour againſt theſe corruptions within, and theſe temptations without, and yet it is not; but I know it is done in heaven, it wants nothing but the taking out,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:4394:341"/> thou wilt beſtow upon thy ſervant what thou ſeeſt fit: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Hannah</hi> wept ſore, and prayed to the Lord, and went away, and was no more ſorrowfull, and ſhe ſaid, Lord, I beleeve that I ſhall either have a childe, or that which is as good, or better; now the buſineſſe was done, but imagine the Lord delayes, and doth not ſuddenly accompliſh what hee intends, and thou haſt uſed meanes to receive, he gives not, and grants not, and ſends not ſuccour according to thy deſire, and the tenure of the covenant, as thou conceiveſt.</p>

You know what the Lord did to the woman of Canaan, when ſhee had ſtriven with him a great while, and would take no deniall, at laſt he ſaith, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt,</hi> take what thou wilt, if thou wilt have life for thy child, &amp; peace for thine own conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, take it,

I might here have taken ſome of the moſt deſperate caſes that could be, that you might have ſeen what faith would have done in the midſt of the want of all meanes, and in the greateſt extremity that could have befalne a poore ſinner, but I will not ſtand about it now at this time: now therefore conſider what hath been ſaid, lay theſe things up, and have them ever by you, and practiſe them, and by often writing learn to write, and by often living learn to live: many people live poorly, and make a poore ſhift to go to heaven; but I would not have a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to live ſo, but be the maſter of his art; know and ſee your way, and uſe the meanes, and labour to get good thereby, that you may have ſap and ſweet of the promiſes, and goe ſinging, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, &amp; triumphing up to heaven. Now that which I conclude withall, is this; you ſee how far the Lord hath brought us, how the ſoule hath beene prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and cut off from ſin and himſelfe, if fitted for the Lord Jeſus by contrition and humiliation, and that the ſoule comes to ſee, that there is no hope in the creatures, nor any ſuccour in heaven, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo at laſt the ſinner comes, and lies at the foot-ſtoole of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and knowes that either he muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, or a damned man: now when he ſees that prayer, and all other meanes will not profit, and the power of the meanes yet prevaile not, and
